# Hi, this is AJ with another effortless English podcast.So today is Monday and I'm here in San Francisco. I'm back in San Francisco.Last week we were in Texas.We were at a teaching conference and the leader of the teaching conference was Blaine Ray.And first I just want to say some nice things about Blaine Ray because he's a super nice person. He's a fantastic teacher.He's a great teacher trainer. He really helps teachers become better and better. And I went to Moe went and Kristen went and Joe went. We all learned a lot. We will all improve our teaching as a result of going to the conference. So thank you Blaine Ray. You are great. See the next thing that happened last week was that our computers crashed. Oh no, oh no. Yes our website crashed. So what happened? First we got too many visitors. We got a lot of traffic. People watching the videos and trying to comment all suddenly same time. So that crashed our site. Our website went down. But you know that's okay.That's not a terrible problem. Usually you can recover quickly. But the next problem was that our backup file, our website backup had a problem. The website host, Bluehost, Pugh. Terrible. Don't use them.Bluehost, their backup file was bad.It had some, it was corrupt is what they say.But it basically had some problems.It was broken a little bit.So we could not get the website up again quickly.So finally our computer engineer, his name is Vic Medcalf.He worked hard, he worked, he worked.Trying to talk to Bluehost again and again.Finally he got a good backup file.Then we moved everything to new computers, new servers and a new web host.Doing expensive, high quality and professional.So now we are ready for a lot of traffic suddenly.And that's good because our English is coming soon. Our one day only sale. Unfortunately we must change the date again. We were hoping for tomorrow. But because our website crashed last week we need to delay. Our English just one more week. So the new date, the final date, the one day only sale for Power English is now August 4th. August 4th, that's next Tuesday, August 4th.One day only Power English sale.Now to get Power English you must be on my email list.You must join the 7 Rules email course.Because what happens at 12.01 am.Just after midnight in New York City, that's New York City time, I will send an email to everybody in the 7 Rules email list. That actually will be almost 1 million people. Because our friends, Kristen and Joe, they are also sending emails. Anyway, you will get an email and it will have a link inside. Click the link. The link will go to the Power English sale page. Then you just click that big red button. It will say bye lessons now, etc. Click that red button. You get Power English. So if you don't know about Power English then you probably are not on my email list.And don't worry about it, you're fine.You can just listen to my podcast.It's too late for me to tell you everything about Power English now. But if you are wanting Power English then you need to be on my email list. And you probably already are. Okay, so anyway, so August 4th, it's only one day and only 15, 000 copies.So we are limiting the number of lessons on August 4th to just 15, 000. I think probably most of those will be gone quickly in a few hours.So if you really want Power English, I recommend that you open your email immediately at 12.01am.Just after midnight, you know, midnight, you have August 3rd, 11.59.And midnight becomes August 4th in New York City.Check your email.That's when the email will come and that's when you can get Power English.Okay, so enough of that.What else am I doing? So I just finished doing some videos because we lost a little bit of work, a little bit from the website crash just three days.So today I have been making videos and doing some work to recover what we lost.And then later tonight actually we are going to see Harry Potter.I'm going to see the new Harry Potter movie. It will be Kristen and Todd, my good friend Todd. I don't know if Joe is going to go.You guys know Kristen's from Learn Real English. Todd is just a good friend of ours. And of course, Tomoe and I. We're all going to see the new Harry Potter movie.Yay! And you know I have never read the Harry Potter books.So I don't know what happens in this story. So the movies are fun for me. When the new movies come, I really have no idea what's going to happen.So I enjoy it.Maybe someday I'll read the books. So again, anyway, that's it.I guess that's the big update. So the computers are working again. We have a totally new system, very professional and expensive unfortunately. But that's okay.Very professional.We are ready for a lot of traffic now.We are growing fast.And now we're ready. We are ready for almost 1 million people, possibly, to come and try to get power English. Power English, the one day only sale is now August 4th next Tuesday. New York City time, it's just after midnight, 12.01 a.m.Just after, you know, just when August 4th begins, the first minute, that's when power English starts. Check your email then. And finally, we're going to see Harry Potter tonight.Okay? Well, as always, you can check my Twitter page for daily audios every day.I do a short audio.Sometimes more.That's twitter.com slash a j hoag, a j h o g e.

# You're listening to Luke's English podcast. For more information visit teacherloop.co.uk. Hello, welcome back to the podcast. All right, how are you doing? I hope you're doing fine in podcast land, in Lepland. I hope you're having a nice morning, afternoon, evening, night. Whatever time of day it is, wherever you are, hello, welcome. Kate Billington is back on the podcast again in this episode. Kate is a popular guest. This is her fourth appearance on the show. Just in case you don't know or in case you've forgotten, Kate is an English teacher like me. We work together in the same school. She also does stand-up comedy in the evenings sometimes, like me. Kate also makes cakes. She's a professionally qualified cake maker. She makes cakes and pastries. And Kate loves cycling. And in fact, this episode is called Kate Billington Cycled to Berlin. So here is about two hours of Kate and me in conversation. Natural conversation, conversation that flows this way and that way as it moves forward. So yeah, two hours, it's another long episode. And so with this, I just invite you to join us. Try to follow the conversation. See what bits of English you can pick up along the way. You don't have to listen to the whole thing in one go. Obviously you can if you want to, just join us for the whole two hours. But you don't have to listen to it all in one go. You can listen to some and then stop. And then later you can listen to some more. The more you listen, the more you learn. But it's up to you if you feel like after half an hour, that's enough for you. If you feel like you wanted a half an hour episode, listen to half an hour of this. But otherwise, if you're enjoying it and you are captivated, keep going because the more you listen, the more you learn. Hopefully, we will keep this fairly entertaining and enjoyable for you all the way through with some jokes, some little stories, and some little explanations of vocabulary or expressions or little cultural details. Consider listening to the audio version on your phone. You know what a phone is, right? Consider listening to the audio version, which you can just get in a podcast app on your phone. I use pocket casts, but you could use Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts Spotify. You could listen to the audio version, just subscribe to Luke's English podcast in your podcast app of choice. And the advantage of that is that you can do other things while you listen. Just put your headphones on. And you can just do other things while you're listening, which allows you to multitask. Like, you could do some housework, you could drive, you could walk around somewhere, just walk around in a circle or alternatively walk to a specific place. If you've got some shopping to do or something, while you're spending time on public transport on the way to work and on the way back or whatever it is you're doing, this is how most people listen to podcasts. They just listen to the audio version allowing, which allows you to do other things at the same time. That's another way to do it. Alternatively, you could just close your eyes and just focus on the words, phrases, and sentences that you can hear. But don't do that while driving a car or operating heavy machinery or any of those other dangerous things. But there you go. Anytime you want to stop, you can just pause the episode. And all podcast apps will remember where you paused so that when you come back to the episode, you'll be able to continue from that moment and then carry on. And ultimately, I think it's probably best not to think about the length of the episode. Don't see this as a mountain that you have to climb. The length, it doesn't really matter. Just join us, get involved in our conversation, keep listening, enjoy it, and get carried away by the sounds of the English language in motion. One last thing before we start properly, this episode is called Kate Billington Cycle to Berlin. And that was the original plan for this episode to talk about her long cycling adventure to Berlin, cycling all the way to that city. But in the typical way here on Luke's English podcast, there were plenty of tangents, distractions, and other talking points along the way to that main topic. And you'll see me trying to get there. But for some reason, we end up talking about this, that and the other, which is fine. That's the whole spirit of this show. So we do eventually talk about Kate's cycling trip. And there's also a story about a nice, a nice, no, that's not the word. Definitely not the right word, not nice. Nasty. There's a story of a very nasty cycling accident that Kate had recently, which will definitely hold your attention. So we do talk about those things about the cycling, but it takes us a while to get there. When do we, when exactly do we start talking about the cycling trip and the cycling accident? Well, you'll have to wait and see. But keep listening because we do get there eventually. So now, without any further ado, let's now join my conversation with Kate. And we jump straight in with me attempting to start the recording of the video and audio tracks while also making tea and talking to Kate all at the same time. It's exactly the same way that the last episode with Kate started. So more of the same kind of stuff, more conversation with Kate. All right, good. So now I've said that. Let's get started right now. And here we go. Click record here. So I have started. And so my decision there to start was based on, oh God, it's difficult to explain. Why? Well, because, okay, maybe I shouldn't have started now. I should have just finished the tea and then started. But I just kind of think I'll just press record and then I don't have to worry. That's done. And then we can just carry on. And that's, you know, living with regret now. Now we can say, should a wood a cutter? Yeah, should it should it should it teach your students that expression? Go ahead. Should a wood a cutter as a song, isn't it? Is it Macy Gray? Could be. I don't know. I don't know that. You don't know that song. No, I don't think so. I'm not going to sing it because that would be embarrassing for everybody. If you use this in an English lesson by any chance. I have. I've used it for pronunciation because it means should have and would have and could have. So it's like, it's about somebody regretting their, like, I think it's about her regretting losing a partner or or something like that breaking up with somebody. And the song says, the song says all the things that she should have done and could have done and would have done if she could go back and change it. But the song isn't called should have, would have. Thank you. Could have. It's called should a wood a because that's how we actually say it. Yeah, should have done this. I should have, I should have put the milk in, you know, before I started press, before I press record, I should have done that. Should have done this is that I should have given Kate the tea earlier when I invited her onto the podcast last time. Yeah, calculated it was. It was over 30 minutes that you had to wait. I think that's the first time in my life I've ever been 30 minutes without tea. Really? It's always like at least maximum 30 minutes. I would chain tea, drinker. Yeah. Yeah. So you have to, there's no more than 30 minutes between each cup. Yeah. Okay. And I would have refused to come back except that you said lots of people listen to the episode. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So see, that was, I was just trying to find an excuse to use wood a right? That's why I said that sentence. I would have come back. Yeah, I would have, I would have refused. I would have refused. I think it's, you know what, I think it's wood of, I think it's a thing. Macy Gray is American, isn't she? Yeah, she is. So I would have refused, but was American? What, she changed her nationality or she died? I think she might have died. Do you really? I don't know. She might have died. You did that. You did you just say that sentence? I said might have, didn't I? Didn't say might have. And so the point we're trying to make for people who are actually here to listen to their English and not find out whether or not Macy Gray is to rely on is that Americans would often say shoulder and Brits would often say should have, yeah, but nobody would say in the context of a normal sentence should have, with like the strong pronunciation of have unless they're, unless they're emphasizing it for a certain reason. I don't know what that reason would be. Maybe if you say a should have gone to the doctor and they say you can't go to the doctor now and you go no, no, no, I should have gone to the doctor. Yes, but that's you would probably also emphasize the gone. I should have gone. You'd probably still, but you'd say they have your right. You'd say should, I should have gone to the doctor, but you can still, there's still time. I should have gone. Yeah, you don't say it's both. It's a question. Yeah, she's still alive. Yeah. Macy Gray, how old is she? She's not even that old is she? Natalie Renee McIntyre, known by her stage name, Macy Gray is an American R&B soul and soul singer and actress. She's known for her distinctive raspy voice and a singing style heavily influenced by Billy Holiday. Gray has released a 10 studio albums and received five Grammy award nominations winning one and she's still very much alive. I don't know why you thought that she'd passed away. I don't know. Just now that Tina Turner's gone, I've seen they've all gone. All singers. All R&B souls. All great R&B souls singers have gone. I heard her first. Tina Turner, that's Pity lost another legend. I heard about that in class. One of my students said it and I had to lean on the table and I was like, I'm sorry guys, I'm going to need to take a minute. Yeah. Because I was very shocked. Same thing happened. And they all knew. They all knew that you were shocked. No, they all knew that she had died and I was the last one. Really? So they got to enjoy you receiving the news. They found it quite funny. Did they? It was to be fair, it was quite funny. Also, you received the news and you were shocked. Yes. Not that she died. No, that's just sad. It's quite sad but it's not a tragedy. Is it? She was 83. Yeah, she led a good life. She had a good innings. I taught them that expression. Yeah. Yeah. Only use that in Britain. They don't say that in the States then or Australia or. Okay. So in cricket playing countries maybe. Yeah. Yeah, I guess. But so yes, maybe they would say in Australia, India, South Africa. I don't know. Sean, we explain she had a good innings. Since this is a learning English podcast. Yeah. Yeah. Also, I'm not supposed to be like vain but I'll just notice my hair's a bit weird. I'm just going to fix that. Go ahead. So we're on video, obviously audio listeners. There's a video camera filming us which is an interesting experience. We talked about that last time. This is what happens when you come onto my podcast. We just talk about the same thing we talked about in the previous episode. We do. Which is probably the thing we talked about in the previous episode to that. Somehow just go over the same ground every single time. But yeah, so she had a good innings. Right. So innings. So I think if you wanted to use a more international expression, you'd say she lived to a good age. You say it was 83 as a good age. Yeah. And that's I think that would be quite universal as an expression. Yeah. But a good innings is it refers to cricket. And it refers to a cricket score. So when you're batting, the goal is to get as many round as many runs as possible. Yeah. Not there are no goals involved. Sorry, sorry. The goal, the objective, the objective is to get as many as many runs as possible. And that's and your innings is the amount of time that you're batting. Yeah, you can stay in for you can stay in for ages. You can stay in bat until someone balls you out. You can stay in all you can be in all day or you could be in for several days. You could be in for several days. It would include multiple tea breaks. Yeah. Because that's not even a joke because this is a British sport. It's great isn't it? I love cricket so much. I miss cricket. I actually have a cricket ball here. Which is just like a it's just a really good sort of stress reliever. All right. Okay. It's just cricket balls are wonderful things. They're covered in leather and they've got these stitching stitching the seam down the middle, which is actually an important part of the game because you can if you're bowling the ball, you have to bounce the ball and you can throw it so that it bounces on the seam and that makes it unpredictable. Is it going to go this way that way and other things? But so yeah, seeing cricket, if you are batting, if you are hitting the ball, you can stay there all day if no one gets you out. And if you do have a long innings and you stay there for a long time and you get a good score, then yeah, you would say, oh, he had a good innings or she or she. Yes. Well, she'd be a female cricketer. Yeah. Or they, well, we do not know. Yeah. Exactly. If they're at a distance or it just wasn't clear or for some any other reason. But so Tina, yeah, we do say that about someone who's lived a good long life. And it's a sort of a positive thing to say when someone has died. Yes. If they've had a good long life, you can say, well, you know, he had a good innings. She had a good innings. Yeah. Yeah. I think we say I say quite a lot if somebody's, yeah, if somebody's died at an age that suggests they lived a good life or lived a plentiful life. Absolutely. Yeah. She had a good innings. I was still a bit upset when she died. And I still had to lean on the table. Similar thing happened to me when David Bowie died. That one hurt, didn't it? Yeah, it did. Because it was unexpected. And he just released an album and he was kind of like, you know, back in our thoughts and stuff like that. Like a week before I saw the video for his latest single and it was strange and it was weird and it disturbed me. This is the video. The video did, yeah. Okay. For Lazarus. Not very. Lazarus. I think it was. Oh, that was perfect. Dark Star or something like that. There's very odd. Lots of sort of what looked like a cult imagery and references to his career and weird things. I didn't know what to make of it. I watched it early in the morning. The next week, I was just about to go into an English lesson and one of our colleagues Rob. Do I remember Rob? Not the Rob that was there now, but Dylan. Dylan. Dylan, do you remember Dylan? Also, still there now. No, there's another Dylan. Yeah, there's another Dylan. Yeah, Dylan Walker. I think if there'd been two Dylan's, I would have been more aware of it. Maybe he left before you kind of got a chance to meet him. He does have a podcast as well now called English with Rob even though his name is Dylan. But yeah, Dylan, this is middle name or I don't know, it's confusing. But yeah, anyway, so he came into the teacher's room. It was like maybe 10 minutes before I was due to go into class and start teaching. He came into the teacher's room. He started, David Bowie just died. And I was like, what? What? You know, and then I had to go in and teach. And I was like, okay. So today's lesson is about David Bowie died. And one of my other students was a huge David Bowie fan and she was like, yeah, I know. Oh, no, sure. Yeah. Yeah, so the whole lesson we were both like this. Yeah, he was ill. So that was that why his last album was about what his career had been and. Yeah, yeah, lots of sort of deep hidden meanings and a lot of stuff like that. The video's gone off. The computer went to sleep, but we are still being filmed. The video is still rolling. All right. Okay. All right. So, okay. Well, we've already covered quite a lot of ground there. Yes. Yeah, we have. Yeah. Yeah. So you have to have a plan for the podcast. Yeah, I do have a plan. Yeah. I did write some notes. Are we going to talk about last? Like the last appearance? Yeah. That's not part of the plan. No, I thought that we would start by, well, let's see. So I saw you recently or you texted me and you said, can I come back on the podcast? Yeah. I said, of course you can. And you said, because I want to talk about cycling to Berlin. Yeah, I did want to talk about that. And then after I said it, I was like, I've not really got many stories about it actually. Really? Because when you cycle somewhere, a lot of the time, you're just, you're just on your own on a bicycle. Yeah. It's not really anecdote rich. Unless it's a tandem. Well, then you'd be on your own on a tandem. Yeah, you're not necessarily going to have another person on it. Are you? No. I like to cycle alone because other people are quite annoying. And I'm also quite annoying, especially on long holidays. Really? Yeah. Why? What happens? I just, so cycling's quite stressful sometimes because obviously you've got to get, you've got to get to the place you want to get to by the end of the day. And if you have things like punctures or if you get lost or anything like that, then it's quite, you can get quite stressed. And then I get very angry and I shout out at my bicycle or I shout out at my phone or my GPS. If I go wrong. Yeah. What kind of, what kind of things do you shout? Can you say? I don't think I swear. You could I don't want to swear. No, I don't think it's very polite. Fair enough. Fair enough. Yeah. Some, there are times when swearing is appropriate. And one of those times is when you're cycling and you're trying to get to a certain place and you're climbing up a hill or something like that. And things are difficult and you're, you have frustration and you vent it against, you vent at an inanimate object. Which I think is fine because the inanimate object can take it. And I do always say sorry as well. Afterwards, I always feel bad. And then I always think if it's maybe it's not as inanimate as I think it is. And maybe it's going to be angry with me and stop working. Yeah, you never know. Especially with your phone. Because they're that close to to being sentient now, aren't they? Yeah. Yeah. You've got to be careful what you say to your phone. I mean, I've got a very old phone. So I think it's quite far from being sentient. That's really on it. Yeah. Yeah. But I, I, I, I don't really apologize to my phone. I don't, I don't like my phone. So yeah. Where is it? It's in my bike helmet. It's probably here. It's just there. Yeah. Your phone's just feeling sad. I don't like phones in general. You know, no, because they're just, I don't like the fact that you kind of, we don't have to have one. But I feel like I have to have one. Yeah. You know? No, I know completely. Yeah. I mean, they're obviously very useful. But also we have to have them now. Don't we? Yeah. It's not choice anymore. We've been forced to kind of do that now. But yeah, they're often I am much happier when I take steps to put the phone away. I keep it in my bag and I write, I will not check it. Because you know, we're being psychologically manipulated and we just have to, we just pick it up without even realizing it. Like the decisions been made for us. Yeah. But you will now pick up your phone. You haven't picked up your phone for, for however many minutes. Yeah. So you, and I check my, you know, it hasn't gone off because no one texts me or calls me ever. But I'll check it just in case. Yeah. Why? There's, you know, you know, Sandy Toxfig. Yes, the comedian. The comedian. Yes. He is brilliant in my opinion. But she had a joke about how that's like just opening your front door just in case somebody's there. That's so true. That's basically what I'm doing. Is there someone here? No, there's not. Okay, I'll close it again. That's basically what you do when you're just checking your phone with a good reason. But when you do check your phone for no good reason, yeah, it's like opening your front door just to check if someone's there. But it's also like finding yourself standing at the door with the door open and you're like, oh, I was going to the kitchen to make a cup of tea and I'm standing at the door. For some reason, you're standing at the door. Yeah. Exactly. I do that with like, you know, Twitter. I'll go on my phone because I need to get, I need to find an email that someone sent me from last week because I've got to do a specific thing. And then I'll really like, and then I'm scrolling through Twitter and like, whoa, wait a minute. I thought I was doing writing an email. How did this happen? Because you open your phone and in there it is and then, and then it gets you like that. But you can get apps. Sorry, I cut you off. That's all right. Okay. Well, I was going to say, I'm going to say it now. You can get apps that stop you from accessing certain other apps. At times that you fix. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you can't open a Facebook except between this time and this time or Twitter in your case or. But in order to do that, you need to go into your phone, open up that app and decide the hours that you want. And what would happen to me is I go in, I'm going to set my, my allowances, my time windows and then, oh, I'm on Twitter. So you'd never actually get there because there's always some other app that's like, hey, jumping in the way. Yeah. Literally. That is what it is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I think that's why I don't like my phone. I tend to find I have happier, more fulfilling moments when I keep my phone at a distance. You know, you can have live in the moment a lot more. And that's, that's good. Yeah. So all right. So cycling to Berlin then. Yes. So you're going to tell us about this. Yes. Let's see, let's see where this takes us. Probably to Berlin. Probably. In terms of the conversation. So, okay, when, where, how, why, what, which, whom, which, which, which, I don't know, which, which, which route did you take? Oh, good, good question. What's the difference between what and which? That's a question that students ask me sometimes. Oh, I would say, well, the reason I asked then when Luke said which, I said which what? Because which suggests a choice between multiple options. So we can use it either when the options are clear, like here, which route did you take? So you're talking about the various possible routes from Paris to Berlin. Or if it's just implicitly clear, like if you said which color is your favourite? It's obviously a limited number of colors. Yes. Yeah. Although, of course, some people would argue that that is not a limited number of colors. What is the in-limit really? Well, because it's, well, it's supposed it is limited, but all of the possible shades. Yeah, you get that kind of spectrum. Yeah. Okay. I see you. I see what you mean. But anyway, it's, it's not like, when you go on the internet and you want to choose a color for a particular thing if you're making some artwork or something, then yeah, then there are many, many, many, many little codes and subcodes. And yeah, if you break it down, that's true. But you could still say which color is your favourite. Yeah. But probably what is your favourite color? You've been most common question. So the point is that which is normally when there's a sort of limited number of options available, for example, if you've got like three cakes on the table, which cake would you like? We have got cake. I know. Yeah. I know. I should say Kate brought cake, of course. Is that why you thought of the example of cakes? There's not a choice of cakes. Cake is always a good example for most situations. All of my examples are right cake. Yeah. Kate did bring cake, I should say. The cake brought the cake, not the cake brought cake. Has that, that wouldn't be possible. It would be interesting if a cake brought you here. I don't know how that would be possible. Who knows? One day when the cakes become sentient as well as the phones, then maybe we'll be riding around on cakes. That's the future we have to look forward to. But I think cakes have got further to go than phones. I'm going to put that out there in terms of sentience. But phones are always developing, always sort of changing, apparently getting better. But cakes, maybe they've finished, they're already great. They don't need to be improved as a concept. So you did bring cake, which you have in the... Did you like some cake? Well, you know what? Often I will share comments from the comments section. One said it's rude to eat on a pukka. Is that what you're going to say? I read that and I have to say to that person, I'm sorry, you're just going to have to deal with it. Yeah, really? Yeah. Really? Really? Because, okay, so... Do you think is rude to eat on a pukka? First of all, the vast majority of comments were extremely positive. Oh, okay. You're going to have the negative one. No, no, no, no. I love this. I'm just saying this just for posterity. So everyone knows, the vast number of comments are positive. Whenever I talk about comments, if I ever bring up negative comments, I always feel like I should balance it by saying most people's comments were positive. So I don't, first of all, give the impression that one comment out of 100 comments was negative, that by just talking about the negative one, that that somehow makes it more significant than the others. You don't want to give it more weight? Yeah, exactly. And I should have. Yeah. Yeah. And also, I can't remember the other points I was going to make in my list. I think I said several reasons, but never mind. What the first one will do. But, yes, so vast majority of comments were positive, but there was one comment that simply said, I think, eating on a podcast is rude. That was the contribution that that person made to the conversation. Don't you think so, though? Because I think that person, although, that was the only thing they said, I think that that person might have a point that there's that as, you know, that there's one that, you know, when people are listening, they don't necessarily want to hear in the background. No, I don't think we could. I don't think that eating was audible. Well, because I think I think why I ate, because it was only me who was eating as well, wasn't it? Because you already eaten. That's right. I gave you some of the cake that I'd bought. I think that when I ate, I ate while you were talking. Yes, so you were like eating. I was away from the microphone. So I think it's rude to eat in somebody's ear. Yes. I would agree with that. And if you eat into a microphone, but you know, people are going to listen to, that's like eating it to someone's ear. Yes, so if the listener can hear the sounds of eating, that's rude. I think that's rude. But if the listener is aware that a human is eating in the room, that's not rude per se, is it? Because I wouldn't say that's rude. But I'm not a hundred percent sure that you couldn't ever hear me eating. But I think yeah, maybe there was just one single like sound in the background. Maybe it was just like the wind blowing the door against the door frame. Not the sound. Not me eating. I do have a large mouth, but not quite that large. Yeah, that's not really anything like the sound of anyone eating, but when there's a little background noise, sometimes these sounds can come indistinguishable from each other. Sure. I would disagree with that person. Yeah. So what you're saying is that there's a difference between eating on the podcast and then eating professionally, professional podcast eating, which is eating away from the microphone, only when another person is talking. So you're not going, yeah, good point. You know, not that. But instead of... Which you've now done. Which I've now done, but there was no feed in my mouth, so that was a sim... That wasn't real eating. So would that person find it more polite for you to make eating noises while not eating, or to eat, but stay away from the microphone? Eat, but make no noises, or make noises, but not eat. Which one is worse? Yeah, that's the question. That's the question. To pretend to be eating into everybody's ears. So if I go lovely cake, delicious. Yeah, like that. Thanks. Yeah. You could put headphones on by the way, Kate. I've got... Why, so I can hear that more clearly? So you can hear that even more. What's going to ask about the head friend? Yeah, yeah, I forgot to mention that. You can put them on if you... Why? Why should I put them on? Just in case you want to get a sense of your proximity to the microphone, you know, because they can help. Can you hear that? Yeah. Loud quieter. I don't know. Okay, well that sounds... I think it's about the same volume as you. People do sometimes ask me that in comments. Why are you wearing headphones? They don't ask it in that voice, but that's the voice that enters my head when I read that comment. And it's just because it helps you monitor the sound. It helps you know if you're close or far from the microphone, you know, and because of the proximity effect, you see, the closer you enter the microphone, the more you sound like you're on the radio. And the further away you get, you know, you can use the proximity for different purposes. If you want to shout, for example, you shout off the microphone. If you want to... If you want to whisper, you have to whisper close to the microphone. So hearing your own voice through the microphone helps you to deal with all of those things. Professional podcasting advice. You were... All I was thinking while you were talking was, this would be a great time for me to have a bit of cake. Yeah, because now he's going off on more. Luke is talking for a while. Yeah, yeah. Well, all right. Okay. But I don't know what's... The jury's... Conclusion. What's the conclusion? Well, you've given it... You've made it an audience participation question. I have. But this isn't a live podcast. Yeah, I know. So how are we now? Ultimately, on the boss, I decide. I think we can eat, but we eat responsibly. And if you're listening... You're right. Drinking alcohol. You should do that responsibly, though. Yeah, most things. I think you should do most things responsibly. Yeah, that's true. But certainly some of them should be done with more of a sense of responsibility than than others, because drinking alcohol can go badly wrong. Whereas drinking tea, this is how wrong can it get? I mean, you might need to rush to the Lou after a certain amount of time, but that's probably as bad as it's going to get, isn't it? Yeah. Well, you could slosh it all down yourself. Tea is hot, so you could spill it on someone and that and actually quite hurt them. Yeah. So these are examples of how you should drink tea responsibly. Yeah. There we go. Make sure it goes into your mouth, down your throat, and not all over someone. And not all over someone. All yourself, because you could burn yourself, and that would be inconvenient. Yeah. Okay. Well, see, I just heard you drinking the tea. I know. I'm sorry to that person, genuinely, right? That person who commented and said that thought that was rude, but we don't mean to be rude or anything. I'm sorry if your experience was diminished by the, even the thought of a person eating. I get it, but I don't think you could hear us eating. You could hear me eating, but perhaps I'm wrong. Yeah, yeah, we'll see. We'll see when that person comes back with a similarly. Yes. Kurt reply. Maybe their name is Kurt. Yeah. I don't think that's what it was, but. Look at this, everyone. Video viewers, listeners will describe. We see if the video is working. Yeah, the video is working, so my computer is just kind of way to sleep. How do you know the computer's locked? It is, it continues to record even in the background. No, I was going to say, how do you know what can be seen? Oh, right. Okay. So what do I need to describe this to the audio listeners? I'm holding a tin in my hands. It's a circular, around tin with a Marmite on the front, a picture, a nice design of a jar of Marmite. There's a whole other conversation that can be done. Marmite is a sort of a yeast extract spread, which is a great way of selling it. But anyway, what's it? Also, describing it, because nobody listening to that knows what that tastes like. No. Well, that's yeast extract. Let's put Marmite. That is what it is. Let's put Marmite on the side for a moment. All right. And we may come back to Marmite, but because it's very easy for us to get distracted by one thing or another, especially Marmites. And I'm holding this thing and I've got to, you know, to continue. So, all right, metal tin. It's round. There's a nice picture of Marmite on the front, but that's not what's inside. We take off the lid. What do we have inside? Cupcakes. Beautiful cupcakes. Or I can smell them as well. I can smell vanilla. Yeah. Good. So, can you describe the cupcakes? Yes. So, the cupcakes, I brought cupcakes because last time I think I talked about cake, but I hadn't brought it. And it was the first video episode we've done. And I felt quite self-conscious about the fact that I hadn't actually brought cake, even though it's suddenly a visual media. Most people don't bring cake to things, you know, it's not like the standard that you have to try to... That's how I make all my friends. Yeah. I bring cake. You bribe them with cake. Yes. And then people are like, oh, we should invite her to staff because she'll bring cake. This is how I make my friends. During lockdown, I was studying pateeserie at home and became friends with all of my neighbours because I live alone. So, I was making loads and loads of pateeserie. So, I would make like 16 croissants and then be like, wow. I should probably deliver these to people instead of eating them alone. It's very nice. You're really contributing to the community. Yeah, and then I became friends with those people and incidentally, they invited me to Berlin. That's why I went to Berlin. But anyway. It does all connect. It does all make sense. So, the cakes are... So, you said you can spell vanilla. Yeah, I think so. So, what kind of cake would they be in British cake terms? Victoria Spongebob. Correct. Oh, I got it right. Listeners. It's testing if you're really British or not. Victoria Spongebob is... It's kind of cake that's got vanilla flavoring in it. Yes. It's a very sort of simple cake. They have the same cake in French and they call it the four quarters. They're wrong. It's Victoria Spongebob. It is Victoria Spongebob. But they call it that because there are four parts, essentially, the same quantity of each butter, sugar, flour and eggs. And then you also, for the flavoring, you put in vanilla essence and baking powder, which was invented quite near in time to the coronation of Queen Victoria. So, when Queen Victoria was crowned, they invented a new national dish as they do for coronations, probably mentioned on your podcast. And baking powder was a British invention that was taking off because it makes cakes rise and it makes them light and fluffy. So, it was quite a revolution in cake making. And therefore, they made this sponge where previously all the kind of cakes that were made in the UK. And I think in many cultures, we're much heavier. And they would be fruit cakes with dried fruit raisins, that sort of thing. So, it would be a heavier cake whereas now they had learned how to make lighter cakes. And that's why the Victoria Spongebob ended up being the coronation dish when Queen Victoria was crowned. That's from my memory. I might have got a few facts a little bit wrong. Yeah, no, it sounds. I'm not sure. I can't fact check that in my own head. But it sounds right. Yeah. This makes sense. Victoria Spongebob named after Queen Victoria because of all the things you said. I'm not just going to repeat them. No, you can. I could, but why? That might be why I last episode was two hours. Yeah, just repeat everything you say. I do that a lot. But when Queen Elizabeth was crowned, there was a coronation dish as well. Coronation chicken. Coronation chicken. Yeah. Which is what is coronation chicken again? Do you know? Do you know that it's chicken? Yeah. In a sauce. And it's a yellow sauce. It's got almonds and raisins in. Right. There must be some sort of like turmeric or something like that in it. Probably something some kind of spice from India or something like that, right? Yes. Kind of like a very watered down milded version, like English version of an Indian dish. It's very mild. Yeah. It's not spicy at all. Yeah. No, it's very creamy. So it's kind of like a chicken in a in a creamy sauce with raisins and almonds and probably some spices and stuff, but it's not it's not actually hot spicy. No, it's quite nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then when King Charles was crowned, what was it? Coronation. Keesh. But the French apparently were not happy with this because apparently I didn't even look at the recipe. I heard it wasn't actually a Keesh because it doesn't have cream. Yeah, I'm saying egg. I don't know. I'm not sure what according to the French makes a Keesh, a Keesh. And is it like creme fraiche or egg or something that has to be in there? I think it needs to have egg and cream to be a Keesh. And otherwise it's a tart. I see. Okay. Because you can have like a you can have a sweet tart like an apple tart or you could have a savory tart like a vegetable tart. And so if it doesn't have egg and cream, I think it's a tart and not a Keesh. Mm-hmm. I think. So the coronation Keesh, as it was called, what was it? It was a vegetarian. I have no idea what it was. It was vegetarian which made some people angry. Why? Because they're idiots. Sorry, you're not supposed to call people idiot. There has to be the sacrificial killing of a creature. Yeah. Yeah. They wanted they wanted to put a and a remainder in it. I don't know. Probably. That was a very old, break-sati joe. Yeah. Let's not explain it. It's not funny. No. Okay. But I think there was courgette. There was courgette in it, right? It was a kind of vegetable tart of some kind. I can't believe you. I think it was vegetarian because I think I remember people being angry about that. I probably shouldn't talk about it anymore because neither of us know what was our unit. Yeah. We were making it up. But I'm pretty sure there was courgette or some other maybe broccoli or something. And the overall impression I got of the coronation quiche was that could be very soggy. That was my first thought. Good. There's vegetarian, nice one, Charles. But soggy, probably quite soggy. But who knows? He probably didn't cook it himself. I doubt it. Maybe he likes cooking. I don't know. No, I do. No, I do. Well, I don't know. You just probably have mentioned it. Yeah. I expect so. So, lovely cupcakes. Yeah. Victoria Spongebob. Yeah. With what do you call the butter cream? Butter cream. Butter cream whipped butter cream on the top. Yeah. And a raspberry. Yeah. Which is the proverbial cherry on top of the cake. Indeed. Oh my goodness. I'm going to do the cherry on the cake. Here we go again. The cherry on top of the cake. Actually, the raspberry this time. Yeah, it is. The raspberry on top of the cupcake. When you eat when you eat it, you have to you have to cut it in half. Oh yeah. Down the middle because there's a surprise in the middle. What have you put in this? I've ruined it now because it would have been better if you hadn't known. But then I think that might have ruined the eating quite a bit. I'm curious to know what's inside these now. It's nothing revolutionary. No. No. I didn't think so. Yeah, okay. Am I going to be able to drive after a few days? Yes. Do you drive? No. Well, you operate heavy machinery. Do you do that? No, not really. But you know what I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah. And it's not like in the middle I've put like minced beef or something. It's not. It's a good surprise. It's a good surprise. I reckon it's chocolate in the middle. Do you know? Yeah. That's what I reckon. Maybe something like a kind of a hazelnut chocolate or something like that. I'm going from Nutella, but not naming the brand. Nutella, but not Nutella. Yeah. Yeah. It's a better version like without all that palm oil grief inside. You know, orangutan grief. It's the second time we've talked about orangutan. I think we started talking about orangutans before we start before we press records. They're like, what orangutans? I don't remember this reference. Very rude to talk about orangutans without context. Oh, so I read some other comments. One said that I laughed too much. Oh, yeah. There was one person who just took exception to, and I think I replied saying, I think you'll find that Paul Taylor, who's a regular guest on this podcast, is famous for laughing on the show. Yeah. So you don't have a famous for it. Yeah. He is. Yeah. He's famous for laughing on the show. In fact, there's a, they've got a jingle. Yeah. I don't really do jingle so much. Yeah. Amber and Paul. Amber and Paul. I've got a jingle. And in the jingle, it's basically condensed version of all the comments that people had made about the two of them. The first one is that Amber's got a lovely voice. And the second one is that she has. She does, yeah. Yeah. And the second one is that Paul laughs and everyone enjoys his laughter. Oh, well. So it's like, okay, so he can laugh. That's fine, but not Kate. No. No laughing from Kate. No laughing, no eating. I mean, I feel like my right to drink tea is hanging by a thread right now. Yeah. You just, we're just, we're just, we're asking for it now. Do it anyway. Someone's going to say no liquid, no, no, no, no, no, in vibing of liquids allowed. Kate was breathing too much. Yeah. So I think I switch there. Yeah, yeah. Don't worry. It's still recording. I don't, but I don't like to not be able to see it. Really? Yeah. Just need to know that the video is recording every now and then. Listen, as my laptop goes to sleep, the screen goes all dark. And Kate's like, ah, no, what's happened? I don't know why, because it's not like it's nice to watch yourself. I think it's because I'm checking it if I'm still very red. And the answer is yes. I'm just thinking is this microphone, is this position correctly? Because I don't know. It's your job. I don't want it to like get in the way so that people can't actually see you, but at the same time, I want it to be able to capture your voice. Should I move? Is that good? This is good. Yes. That is good. German. Yeah. Is it a cycle to Berlin? I think this episode might be called cycling, Kate, Billington, cycle to Berlin. And we cycle around the topic. It's okay. It's 90 minutes to actually talk about it. No, but I just wanted to say one other thing about your comments. Some people said that I laughed too much, which? No, I just one person. But some people said that they didn't understand me because I took too quickly. I think somebody said because I talked too quickly and because I was laughing. That was just the laughing is just one person. If you're sure. Yeah, if it's just one person, then forget about it. Okay. So, but I have had that comment before. What, you're difficult to understand? No, that I laughed too much. Like on the mini English lessons, you know, those. Quite a few of those have comments underneath that just say things like, why is she always laughing? And I think that is valid because I'm laughing at nothing. Some of them say she's laughing at nothing. And that's true. But you know what? I don't think it's just you. I think this is a sort of maybe an English thing. And I've noticed this too in various places that us English people would do, and I don't think it's just English people or whatever, but we do sort of laugh sometimes when there isn't necessarily an obvious thing to laugh about. No one has made a joke. You just say something whatever. And then there's laughter. What does that laughter mean? Why do we do this? Is it because we're awkward as a nation? Yeah, I think we're awkward. Yeah. Which just means that we're a bit socially uncomfortable. So we laugh as a way of saying, what does that laughter actually mean? It's like, I guess it's kind of like I'm finding this a little bit funny because I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if I was laughing awkwardly though. I am British, but I'm not a very awkward British person. It's hard to explain. It's hard to explain, isn't it? Yeah. But again, we shouldn't probably shouldn't dwell too much on. No, well, some individuals find a bit annoying. For that, I'm just going to continue to be someone who laughs too much. It's, you know, there's going to be something you don't like about everyone. And if that's the thing you don't like about me, I think it's okay. Maybe there are other things. Maybe now all the comments would be a list. Things we don't like about Kate. Number one, she laughs too much. Number two, she doesn't care that she laughs too much. But number three is valid. She talks too quickly. So I'm going to make an effort on this one to talk more slowly. Yeah, but you say that, right? But again, I mean, I've having done this for quite a long time and having read a lot of comments over the years and received emails and all the rest of it. Okay, so on one hand, yes, we should try to maybe control the speed of speaking and stuff like that. But if we speak too slowly and if people get the impression that we are adapting our speech, other people will come in the comments and say, speak naturally. Please speak normally. We want you to speak at the natural speed. We can understand you, but we can't understand native speakers. We need to get practice of listening to people speaking at natural speed. Okay. So there's going to be someone else. If we make that change, someone else is like, why did you move it? It was better when it was here. Yeah, you know, you can't please everyone. It's true. Sometimes you try. You're please no one. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. All right. But I do think I was speaking too quickly. Well, I understood you. Yes. So how do you judge speaking too quickly? Maybe one of the reasons you understood me though is because we have a lot of cultural commonalities. Commonalities. You're speaking American English again. I did. What did you say last time? You said it in an American accent. It was like something else you said and I said, I'm sure that should be spoken. How we speak in Great Britain in his Majesty's land. Where's my phone? There it is. I don't know. I can tell you what the word was. Oh, you were saying. Did you write it down? No, because someone commented on that just today, I think. Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was like Luke was right. I checked the dictionary and it wasn't really a thing to disagree about. Don't worry. That's okay. I believe that you were right. Okay, this is fun. Luke looks up something on his phone. I should tell you. So you were talking up. No, you were talking about how we understand each other because we have a lot of commonalities. A lot of things in common. A lot of things that are cultural things in common. We have quite similar accents and similar patterns of speech. I think I do speak more slowly if I'm speaking to somebody who's first language is English, but who isn't British? Oh, yeah. Yes. So if you're speaking to Dylan, not the Dylan, I mentioned, but the other Dylan, who's from the States, he's from New York, right? If you're speaking to Dylan, it's like you have to speak very slowly to Dylan because he's a marathon. He doesn't understand. He's a marathon. He's from... Yes. No, what I mean is there's some vocabulary I probably wouldn't use. Yeah. Like what if you saw Dylan, who's from America, the North America, the United States of America, I mean because there are some people who like get annoyed when you say America and you mean the United States of America, understandably. So what would it be? He is from America, but we can be more precise. True. Yeah. So it would be like some English sentence like, alright mate, who was in pairs? Yeah. Not that you would use that. That's not what I meant, but once I... Can't find this comment. No, I don't. That's okay. Let me know another time. Yeah. Once I had like a text conversation with an American friend who was going to meet me somewhere and he said, I'm just getting some food on my way, do you want me to get you anything? And I replied, no, I've already eaten tar. And he arrived to visit me, or to... I don't know what we were doing to hang out. Yeah. And he said, what's tar? What did you eat? You ate some tar? Yeah, but it's tar, spelled T-A. And it just means thank you. But it's very British and I think it's also used in New Zealand and maybe an Australia potentially. I would be surprised. Yeah. New Zealand I'm pretty sure about, but I don't know about Australia. So it is used in other places, but it's not used in America in the USA. It means thanks by the way. It means thanks. I did say that. You did. Okay. Just clarify. Well, you know, I have to repeat everything you say. You have to repeat everything I say. I have to repeat everything you say. Got it. Good. So I said, yes, exactly. When I said to him, I've already had some tar. He thought that was a food item that I had eaten. Yeah. So then he arrived and wanted to know what tar was. Yeah. And you're like, it's like Marmite. Yeah. It's very British. You wouldn't understand. This is still, this is still here in the background by the way. We have to talk about this. Are you putting it on a shelf so we can see it? The listeners will see it and we will forget about it. Love it. Can we have more tea? The listeners will see it. Did you get that? I was in a mistake. I meant the viewers will see it. The listeners will be able to hear the the Marmite calling to us. The tin lid. You'll be able to hear it on the shelf at the back of the room. You won't tell me. I think I'm going to sneeze now. Oh my God. Another one. Another taboo in podcast. Am I allowed to sneeze? You have to say excuse me now. Excuse me. Yeah. You didn't say bless you. Bless you. I was too busy like wicket-keeping for your sneeze. So many cricket references today. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The sneezing. Yeah, yeah. I've sneezed on the podcast in the past and have not said, excuse me because normally we don't sneeze. I normally do say excuse me but I was distracted by the fact that there was a lot going on. Yeah, you see what I mean? A lot going on. That's why I just press record and then that's done. Yes. But yeah, I've sneezed on the podcast before and I had comments saying I think it was very rude that you didn't say excuse me. Yeah, it's true. You should say excuse me. You should do. Especially if you sneeze directly into someone's ear. I didn't do that. I caught the sneeze. Yeah, you caught the sneeze. You didn't let the sneeze pow come out explosive. No, no. I didn't even open my mouth. It's the healthier way to sneeze. I have to say not for other people, not for other people. True. Only for the person who's sneezing. Good point. But I've been told that if you hold a sneeze in that you lose a few brain cells when you sneeze. I don't know if that's true. That's one of those nonsense facts. I don't believe that for a second. Firstly, we're all losing brain cells all the time anyway. You lose a brain cell by laughing or nodding. They lose a brain cell when you laugh as well apparently. Apparently they do. Yeah. Really? But then we're also developing new ones. No, I think that stops after a certain age. Oh, right. Yeah. We're only going downhill now. I'm not sure what age it is. Well, this is my very vague understanding of brain cells that there are so many of them that we are just constantly losing them. Every like every minor impact means you lose brain cells. We don't make new ones. I don't know about the new ones. I think I don't. I think that's if that stops after a certain age. No, I don't think you do. Yeah. Yeah. Well, my listeners can tell. If any long-term listeners, if you've been listening to this show for let's say over 10 years, you can give me an assessment of whether you think of developed any new brain cells in that time or if it's just been a downward trend since the first time, maybe first listen. It looks reasonably intelligent. These days, you're just like, who am I listening to? Like a chimpanzee? We found a microphone. What is this? They are thinking that. Can I segue into a little language point? Sure. Don't you think it's interesting that the expression to go downhill could be positive or negative? Because if, or not exactly to go downhill, but like, for example, it's all downhill from there. It could mean everything's got easier. It's like riding a bike, right? You're riding uphill. That's hard work. And then you get to the top of the hill, or the top of the mountain, or whatever. And then it's all downhill from there. It's so easy. Yeah. You just freewheel. So if you're talking about literally, so there's the literal expression and then there's the idiomatic version. No. Because if you said, if you were working on like a long-term project, you could say, right, I need to get all of these aspects of the project done and lined up. And then it's all downhill from there. But don't you think, though, that the potential, because this, so the expression can mean, you're essentially freewheeling on a bicycle, the best part of riding a bike when you go down a hill. Yeah. It's pretty easy. You just freewheel all the way down. But also, we use it to mean, when you get to 50 years old, and then you've lost so many brain cells, it's basically all downhill from there. It's not getting any better. It's getting worse. That's everything's going down. Getting worse, which is something that I think people say, right? After 50, that seems young. I heard someone say that on a podcast recently. Was it yours? No. No, it wasn't just me hearing myself say it just now. Just now. I heard that so funny. I heard it 30 seconds ago. Yeah, that was me. That was me. But I heard it on a podcast. I think yesterday talking about you get to 50 and then it's all downhill from there, basically. Amen. Everything gets easier. It's like riding a bike. Yeah, maybe in the last episode, you disagree with this because your belief is that as you get older, you get better. Yes, we talked about aging. You talked about being a grumpy old man. No, you told, you told, I'm doing it. Look, I'm pointing. I'm pointing. Grumpy old man. You talked about me being a grumpy old man. I talked about me, probably. I talked about me becoming wise, like a wizard. And you were like, what? Because I think in your head, when I said at the older, I get the more like a wizard I become, I think in your head, you were like, what? Like Harry Potter, they children wizards. No, anyway, we're getting very... I think that's what happened. Okay. Did I mention Harry Potter? No, but that's why I'm just, I think I'm reading that. I thought that, oh God. So I said, as I get older, I feel kind of good because I'm going to get more like a wizard. And you were like, what? What are you talking about? Oh, no, I just think the older you get, the better you get. I think I said that last time. Yeah. But yeah, I would apply that to you. And if you think that means becoming wizard, D. Wizard like. Yeah, I almost said wizardry. And then I was like, that's the noun. That's not an adjective. Wizard, isn't it? Wizard. But that's negative. That's negative. Yeah, that means all like dried up. I think a plant could be wizard if you didn't water it. Yeah, I suppose so. Trish, shriveled. Shriveled. Yes. Please can we have more tea? Yeah, of course. Thank you. I think we didn't finish the point about going downhill. Did we or that done now? But go on. I think the point I was trying to make was that in many contexts, it would mean things have gone things have got worse. Like you might say, oh, that used to be a really nice restaurant. But then they got in a new chef and it's gone downhill. Yeah. For example, that's clearly in the context and from the tone of voice and everything. That clearly means it's not as good as it used to be. Yes. But then if yeah, I think if you're working on something difficult and then you say, so don't worry guys, we've done most of the hard work. Now it's, you know, we've got over the hump of this project. It's just all downhill from now plain sailing. Plain sailing. Plain sailing. Smooth sailing, you could say as well. Yeah. But I was going to say you know, it might be, wouldn't you avoid using it's going downhill now because of the potential misunderstanding in the back of people's minds, they'd be like, oh, what negative, that it's got too many negative connotations. So you'd be using more positive language. It's plain sailing with free wheeling. It's free wheeling. That would be more because that's still the same image of going downhill because when you're free willing, you don't have to pedal. Especially in the corporate environment, you've got to be very sort of everything's going to be positive, vised all the time. I would know. That's why I don't have one of those jobs. Yeah. Well, me too, but this is what I've I've perceived to be the case that has to be made all positive. I think you're right. Yeah. One point for me there. Do we not normally say that you're right? No, I think you do. Do I? Yeah, it's fine. Okay. These cupcakes look so tantalising. I keep showing them to the camera as if as if I'm selling them. What's the point of time I was going to suck up? You were, yes. People who've listened to other episodes will know. You were talking about becoming a chef. That's right. Anyway, we've got to talk about you cycling to Berlin because I think there might be the title of this episode and some people are going to be like, never mind the the laughing and the eating. Just talk about the thing that was on the label. You can change the title though. It's not the titles. Yeah. We determine. Yeah. Well, when you're tackling an episode, you've got to be it's got to be quite punchy and it's got to kind of make people listen. What was the title of the last one? Kate, Billington in the podcast or just you know, just descriptive. Yeah. Oh, good. So while we're talking about things that are catchy. Yeah. Can I ask you a listen is for some advice? Sure. I want a new Instagram handle. So my Instagram handle used to be cake underscore buy underscore cake underscore Paris. Paris. Yeah. Which as you can tell, I was impressed that you knew any of that. But it's not very catchy. Especially because underscores. Yeah. All of the underscores and also I created it when I wanted to open a cake shop in Paris. So it made sense. But now I don't want to do that. And I mostly use Instagram for comedy. So I want an Instagram handle that is catchy. That is not already taken. A lot of them are taken that preferably would refer to cake and comedy. So at the moment, I've changed it to cakey comedy, which is well-bitch, isn't it? Let's be honest. Could be better. Yeah, it's bad. So I need to find something else like Anna who we were talking about earlier, who's a friend of mine who you also know. Yeah. Would that be accurate? Yeah. Yes. She's a good friend of mine. She runs comedy shows in Paris and her Instagram handle is anatomically correct, which is really good. Very good. Because anatomically correct would mean anatomically would mean like for a biological drawing of a plant or an animal or a brilliant animal. I say an animal. Yeah. An atom. Yeah. It means that the drawing, the diagram is correct biologically, all the body parts are there. So we'd call it anatomically correct. Like for example, the simpsons, it's not anatomically correct. Picture of Homer Simpson, that is not anatomically correct. They have four fingers on each hand. Not anatomically correct. Correct. But Anna came up with this Instagram handle and also she's a scientist. So it's got that like science side to it. And it's such a good Instagram handle. It's very clever. Yes. Anacomically correct. It's really good. And I need something that good. But so my cousin came up with top of the Billington. Hey, yeah. Didn't we talk about this before? Did we? I mentioned that before. Have we talked because the first thing I said top of the Billington is the best suggested that or at least verified that I remember because my cousin coming up with it for sure. But maybe you could also have come up with a thing. I think maybe you said this to me before and I was like top of the Billington. Yeah. It is a good one. It is a good one. But I want something that has cake in it. This tin has got cake in it. Oh yeah, and it's mine. Perfect. Ow. Top of the Billington. I don't know what can you do with that. How can you add cake to that? I don't know. Maybe it has got to be something different and not top of the Billington. Top of that, you see that we're going to explain top of the Bill. If you're top of the Bill, it means that a Bill is the list of performers that are on a show. Like a play Bill. That's in the States they still use the term play Bill. But we would call it a program. Right. When you arrive, if you go to the theatre, you get a piece of paper with the actors names on it. We would call it a program. They would call it a play Bill. Yeah. You also see posters for Glastonbury, Music Festival. There's a list of performers on different stages. The one that's at the top of the Bill is in the big letters like Elton John and then other performers afterwards. So top of the Bill is in reference to a show of some kind of being. You can say somebody's top billing as well. A top billing artist or a top billing comedian would mean that if they're on a variety show or a festival or whatever, they'll always be at the top of the list. I think. Yeah. I think so. It's an adjective phrase, right? Yeah. I agree. So top of the Billington is good. I mean. Yeah, it's a reference to comedy and being on a show. It's also sort of selling yourself as well. Yeah. Maybe overselling. You wouldn't want to say, I mean, you have to sell yourself. Fairly rubbish comedian. Yeah. Like, you know, sort of mid to lower mid tier comedian. You wouldn't do that in comedy. You have to try and sell yourself as much as you can, including taking any single positive thing that anyone has ever said about you and putting it into the poster and things like that. So you sell yourself. I think top of the Billington is very good. Why do you need cake in there? There's always has to be cake. Why? You're still holding on to the cake because there's always because you're right. That always has to be cake. I just do. It does there, though. This is my question. Does there really cake? Maybe you need to let the cake go. Maybe I do. Just I haven't even taken a picture of these cakes. They're not going to be on Instagram. It's just going to be Kate. Kate, this is the cake without cake. Yeah. You can do it. This is maybe they don't need the cake. But I will get invited to parties, Luke. Because because they're inviting you for you, Kate, not for the cake. That's the dream. The cake helps. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. People like the cake. That's what you really do. That's really a good thing. I'm not saying you should burn all the cakes. I have burnt cakes. I'm sure you have. It's all part of the learning process. But I think top of the Billington, it's going to be difficult to beat that for an Instagram handle. But then I don't know how. How about this? Top of the top of the Billington brackets cake, close brackets. That's so good. There's cake there, at least. You need to cake in there. There it is. But then I don't know. Do I need to pass you tea bags? Oh yeah, make us a brew. I remember this tin from last time. Yep. I just held it up for the camera. So. I'm all right. I'm still going with my cup. Oh, are you? Lukewarm. My least favourite phrase in the English language. Lukewarm. Yeah. Let's it from Lukewarm. I've no idea why we say, okay, well, let's hold that. I'm going to put Lukewarm over there with the Marmite. Okay. Let's finish the thing we were talking about, which is your Instagram handle. Top of the Billington. What do you think this is? Is there any way of getting cake in there? Does she need to put cake in there? Or is top of the Billington at Instagram.com? That's not an email address. That's not how Instagram works. It's not. I have a really limited understanding of how Instagram works. She's talking to me. You're telling me. Even I know that it's not top of the Billington at Instagram.com. I don't work for Instagram surprisingly. I don't know why they haven't employed me. Despite the fact we've mentioned them a number of times now. This is basically product placement. Yeah. No, I don't understand Instagram either. People keep asking me why aren't you on Instagram? You are now. I have been for ages but I don't use it. It's just one, I've just got one image on it, which is a poster of me performing comedy alongside other comedians from like 2017 or something like that. I don't really use Instagram and that's because I just don't have the time to work out how to use it and then to actually use it. You won't know the answer to my next question, which is if somebody had my old Instagram handle from like a head business card when I was going to open a cake shop, for example. Okay. So if they found that and then they searched for it on Instagram, would it send them to my new one? Can you redirect? Yeah. I mean, I don't have to do anything. I just want if somebody searches for on Instagram, will it redirect to my current name? You're asking the wrong person. I know. I don't know. Sometimes you're listening as might know. But also, I think perhaps this is a problem I don't need to worry about because I don't think that's going to happen very much. Is it? Let's be honest. Are there not like other tags that are included in Instagram profile at Kate Billington cake? Can you not add all those tags in so that when someone searches for these things, if they search for cake, underscore buy underscore cake, underscore Paris, Instagram.com, that they will find you because you'll include all those tags in your profile. Is that possible? Again, we're asking people who know. You do write like a like a bio, they call it, I think. You write a little description of yourself. Mine's just, it just says, I think it says stand up, stand up, cakes and cycling. I think that's what it says. Okay. Can you not include formally cake underscore buy underscore cake, underscore Paris, at Instagram. I bet if I googled this, I'll find the answer. I don't know why I've brought to that conversation with you, with all people. I have mind. That's why because you're using the other people. Using the hive mind of the listeners of Liggs and his podcast to find out the answer. I've still got three things now in my mind. Four things. Thing number one, should we eat cupcakes? Obviously, I want to, but there's just the managing that while also talking to you and that one person who's like fuming right now. There might be more than one. There will be more than one. I've heard this before. I've heard this from audience and from other people on other podcasts, the phenomenon of eating on a microphone and some people feel so strongly about it that generally would advise against it as a professional podcaster. But I don't want to lay down the law too much because you've gone to the effort of making cupcakes and that's fantastic. I actually want to eat one. I think the last time, not the last time, but when I was on the podcaster a few years ago, and we did two quite close together and then there was a very like a two-year break. I think during both of those ones, both times I brought food. I think we ate it during the podcast. I think so too. Maybe because there was a video version of the last one, this person was aware that cake was being eaten. Was the comment on the YouTube? It was our nose on the website, which suggests that they listen to the audio version, although the YouTube version is also available, it's embedded on the website page. There's no way of knowing. And to cut a long story short, we should probably not give that comment a lot more air time. It's credence. But it is in my mind and I'm aware of the issue of eating on a podcast. So that's one thing. Another thing is... I think my rule is if they can't hear it, it's fine. That's my rule. Okay. Okay. So is the person who doesn't have a podcast? Well, you know, you can't please all the people all the time and it would be a shame not to eat some cupcake and let's see if we can do cupcake. There's professional cupcake eating. I bet I could be a professional cupcake. I think you could. Definitely. I'm not sure about me. I don't know if I could manage that. I'm a dream job. Professional cupcake eater. Yeah. Do you have a knife? Should have brought one shouldn't have. I thought I had some... I've got a spoon. What could we use to cut the cake in half? Should we use the edge of the fork? Yes. Okay. Maybe we should use the tin lid as a plate, unless you have plates. Okay. So there should be the cupcakes. That was one thing. Another thing in my mind. I'm voting yes on eating the cupcake. Was Malmite. Yes. Another thing was Luke Worm and then another thing was the potential top-best title of the episode, which is Kate Millington, Cycle to Berlin, but doesn't talk about it very much. Yeah. You want to use the cake lid as a plate? I think that's a good idea. I think that's a good idea too. Choose your weapon. That's an English expression meaning which cake would you like? I'd like this one please. Look, they've been individually wrapped. It would be rude to Kate not to eat this. Do you understand? Do you understand? You've lost that listener forever Luke and it's my fault. Look, I love all my listeners. And people have absolutely have the right to be to find it rude if someone is eating you in their ear. I understand. I understand, but understand also there's a process going on here. It's not as simple as you might think and there are many different competing factors that might cause a person to even knowingly eat a cake on a podcast. You see, it's not just as simple as you might think. It's so much from the point of view of the listeners or viewers, it's almost too dimensional. There's just like, I can't even explain the complex inner workings of a person's brain and all the different things that are swirling around while recording. Whereas when you actually watch it, it looks like one thing just leads to another thing and you don't get the sense of all the complex social and psychological forces that are at work. I'm rambling so much because I can't multitask. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know either what I'm talking about, but I'm never mind. What shall I do here? What's the appropriate thing? There's the raspberry. Just cut it in half. Okay, the raspberry gets cut in half. This is the bit that Kate's been waiting for where the contents of the cupcake are revealed. I thought it would be something chocolatey, maybe a kind of Nutella, but a better better Nutella. Other hazelnut chocolate spreads are available. Is it? What is it? It's jam. It's jam. Ladies and gentlemen, what kind of jam? What do you think? Well, I would say raspberry jam because the raspberry might feel a bit put out if it was strawberry jam or never upset a raspberry that's one of my top life rules. Yeah, this is great. Okay. I would surprise that you guessed chocolate because Victoria sponges traditionally contain jam. Of course they do. So I thought you would immediately say, well, if it's a Victoria sponge, it'll have jam in. Yeah. How does Bob Marley like his Victoria sponges with jam in? Now you've got the challenge. Now I'm going to eat professionally, which means I'm going to set you a little speaking task. Oh, I love a speaking task. So I'd like you to explain the expression lukewarm. I want you to also speculate on why it's my least favourite expression in the English language. Go. So lukewarm is used when something is tepid, which means it is not hot. Normally it means not hot enough. So if, for example, your soup is tepid, you probably want your soup to be hotter. Soup should be either hot or cold. Not so hot, you can't drink it, but like hot. But lukewarm is also used metaphorically to mean that you don't have very strong interest in something. If you're kind of lukewarm on it, it's like you don't have a strong feeling in its favour. You probably, you probably don't mind it, but you definitely don't love it. You feel lukewarm. I would assume it looks at least favourite expression because luke often feels too cold. And therefore, when people use the word lukewarm, he's like, I wish I was warm, but he's not. So he says, oh, a horrible word, taunting me with the thing I wish I had, but I don't. I'm wrong. It's because luke doesn't like it because it means something you don't like very much and it's rubbish to have your name in a word that means you don't like it very much. I think that was obvious, but I thought it would be funny to come up with. It may have been obvious, but it needed to be put into words. That's what this podcast is about. Saying obvious things. But what's not obvious is where it comes from. Do you know where it comes from? I was going to think of a witty response to that, but then I thought now. No, I don't know. What's the origin of the phrase lukewarm? Is the etymology of that? I can't believe you haven't looked that up as a luke. Well, I don't like the phrase. So I'm just like, no, thanks. I'm lukewarm when it comes to the phrase lukewarm. I don't think you are. I think you don't, are these actively dislike it? Yeah, it's clear. Yeah, imagine having, imagine having like another thing like something negative if it was a cake. Right. If there was a word to describe when you eat a cake and it's not very satisfying, it's not moist enough. It's too dry or something. It's like, it's a bit cake. It's a bit cake dry, isn't it? You'd feel a bit put out by that, wouldn't you? Yeah. Listen, as Kate has moved off the microphone, a significant distance. In fact, you know what I could do? I can mute her microphone. Kate's microphone has been muted. And now you don't even need to worry about whether she's eating cake or not. Okay. It's all good. Yeah, no skin off your nose, she said, which is another expression. We might let that one slip. Okay. So there we go. The cupcake has been tasted and it's very good. It's very tasty indeed. Do I, sorry, do I think it's a bit dry? You mean Kate dry? That's not a nice phrase, is it? It's not. You see, you see what I'm living with when it comes to lukewarm, you know, a lukewarm reception. There's another collocation with it. You know, the launch of the product, we were very disappointed with the launch of the new product. Why? We received a lukewarm reception from the customers, you know. Peacefully switched off my microphone again, so I can have the other quarter of cake. Kate's microphone is being muted in three, two, one, muted. So it's, do I think it's a bit dry? No, I think it's fine. I think it's really good. It's a fine line, isn't it? To get the balance right between dry and then on the other hand, soggy, right, which is the other extreme undercooked, which I guess could lead to soginess. Then in the middle, that sweet spot, which is moist, but not too much. So I think it's good. I think it's great. Yeah, very good. Tasty, delicious. Thank you very much. And not so moist that it makes a sound when you eat it. You can eat it quite discreetly, very well-designed, well engineered. Excellent. Good job. What are the other things in my brain? There was also the word mami to the whole mami thing. So Kate's tin has got a picture of mami on the top, although there is no mami in the middle. Basically to put it in a nutshell, mami is a spread that you might put on toast or toasted cheese sandwiches or other things. Are you ready to be unmuted? Yeah. Okay, you're back. Yes. What else would you put mami on? Crumpets. Crumpets, okay. Which are also toasted normally? Savory. It's not sweet. It's very savory. Right, salty, there. Salty. Yeah. And the thing is about mami. So it's made of yeast. It's yeast extract, which is not a great way of selling it. But it's healthy. I mean, it's full of bit vitamin B12, I understand, which is good. But you think so. You're supposed to put just a little bit on. You don't spread it on like butter or something, just a little bit. And it's a- contains B vitamins, it says. Yeah. Does it say which ones? Yeah, probably. Yeah, contains B vitamins. Yeah, probably B12. I suppose, isn't that the best one? I don't know. They kept working on the B vitamins and we got to 12, we're done. And so also, mami is a reference point for things that either you love or hate. Yes. Yes, because- Like mami and Margaret Thatcher. It's those two things. Yeah, I mentioned Margaret Thatcher, Kate's eyes narrowed. Clearly, there's- There's- There's- There's the suggestion that anybody would hate Margaret Thatcher. Right. It's divisive. It's a divisive thing. Yes. People either love it or hate it. And that's- That was their slogan. You love it or you hate it. Yeah. That was- Which I think is very clever marketing, because it turned it into a thing. Yes. To love it. You were sort of declaring your side. Yeah. But for a very long time, I was sort of lukewarm on mami. No. Honestly. By which I mean, I didn't have a strong- I didn't mind it. But I didn't love it. So you're a third category of person? Yes. I ruined that advertising. I thought humans are only into categories. People who love marmari over a hate it. No. There's a third category. I think Brits are supposed to be in one of two categories, because if you are, for example, Australian- Veggie Mike, mate. Yeah. Exactly. You would have strong opinions about mami, not because you hate mami, but because Australia and a few other countries have this other mami that's called Veggie Mike. It's very similar, but it does have a different taste. But I think therefore, for example, an Australian might love Veggie Mike and not hate mami for the taste, but hate it on principle. But still hate it. Because there's rivalry. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Or they might just be like, it's just not as good. Yeah, I think so probably. Yeah. I expect so. But I think British people, people who've grown up in Britain are supposed to have a strong opinion on mami. That's what you're supposed to think. You're supposed to think either love it or hate it. Yes. That's what the advertising slogans tell you. The other thing about mami as well, just to finish off before we start talking about cycling to Berlin at some point in the next 10 years, is that it's one of those foods that you get videos of on YouTube. And it's like Americans react to English food. And it's always like a piece of toast with loads of mami on it and they eat it. And they're like, oh, I got this disgusting. What is this? And they're eating it wrong. Because you're not supposed to put a huge dollar of it on. You're just supposed to build a little liberal amount on top of your toasted cheese sandwich. And it definitely improves it. It gives it a lovely little edge. So there you go. I would say not a liberal amount. To me, a liberal amount is a lot. Oh, really? Yeah. I always thought a liberal amount was like a small amount. Oh, God, I must I'm wrong. I'll be wrong, Kate. I'll be wrong. You said that you were volunteering. Yeah. We're just Google it. We don't get to choose. That's how it works. No, it was a prediction. And maybe it maybe what did I say is a vol- maybe I was volunteering to be wrong. Yeah, it did sound like you were volunteering. But I think I am wrong. A liberal amount, meaning. Let's see. Yeah, a large and generous. Right. Oh, my God. My whole. Everything is going to question. My whole podcast castle is crumbling to the ground now as every single listener questions all of the things I've ever said before. It maybe he said everything wrong in the past. It doesn't even speak English. Now, this is an English what you hear. This is another language that only one person speaks. It's very, very similar to English. In fact, it's exactly the same. Yeah, it's an idiot-elect. It's exactly the same as English except that in Luke-ish, a liberal amount means a small amount. That's the one difference. Other than that, they are the same. And the word lukewarm doesn't exist. Yeah, that's right. But Kate dry does. Yeah, that's those are the differences and that's it. So don't worry. It's in 99.9 recurring percent the same as English. So we're fine. I think everyone's got an idiot-elect, haven't they? Yes, that's why it's called an idiot-elect. Yeah. That's why it's called an idiot-elect. No. That's why the word exists for it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So tell us about cycling to Berlin there. Yes. So wait a minute. Why did you why did you decide to do that? Okay, first of all, let's get the parameters in place. So you cycle from Paris to Berlin? No, because I decided I didn't quite have enough time. So instead, I took a train. You thought I'm going to need to get to Luke's pod room to talk about nothing for 45 minutes. And then yeah, go on. Yeah, I took a train to the border between France and Belgium to a little town called Jumon. J-E-U-M-O-N-T, it's called. And that's right, it's just on the French side of the border. But that way I cut off about, probably about 200 kilometers. And all the trouble that you'd have getting out of Paris? Yes. Because that's often the hardest part. Although to be fair, I think I would have followed the canal, which makes it much easier, because you're just like you fall into it. Unless you fall into it. Yeah. Yeah, but you would have you would have done that. I would have could have. I know. And I've just realized I said would have. Oh my god. I know. I said it because I didn't know what verb was coming next or I was hesitating. That's why. Yeah, it's all right. I just thought people were coming, but there was a bit where she said would have. Well, they will learn from context that that's the way it goes. Sometimes we don't necessarily need to instruct the listeners in the language to show them how it's done by just doing it. Okay. Okay. So you chose to go, you cut out some of that journey. Yes. Because. Well, because some friends invited me to Berlin because they were planning a trip there. So a friend of mine has a brother who lives in Berlin. And so this group of friends planned a trip and they were going to stay with the brother. And there were originally seven people going. And then when I was talking to them at a party, the friend who's kind of a new friend for me, she said, Oh, we're going to Berlin and you should come. But they she thought we're going to Berlin. We're going to need cake. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I had just made a cake for that party. And it was for a friend of mine who had a lot of drink at that party. She had a lot of wine. And we brought out the cake had 36 candles on it because she was 36. She blew them all out. And then she got up on a chair to make a speech and fell onto the cake. It was amazing. Fortunately, the candles had all been blown out. Yeah. And removed or she fell into the candles. No, no, no, she felt that she shoved the candle into the cake with her with her body weight. Wonderful. She only fell onto the side of it. So I was able to repair the cake. Yes. By picking out the candles and using the icing to stick the cake right together. And then I wrote on it, happy birthday. Please don't fall on this again. That was good. So this is the friend who was going to Berlin? She's part of the group. The one who fell on the cake is part of the group. I've not named her in case she listens to this. The only my only regret about the cake falling is that there's no video of it because it was spectacular. Could have been online, right? It could have been online. It would have been a big hit. Epic fails 2023. It was it's such a good video. It was sorry, it was such a good moment. It would have been such a good video, but anyway, it doesn't exist. But at that party, there's other friend inviting me to Berlin. And it turned out they were going at the first weekend in May, which is the end of our school holiday. So I looked at the calendar and I thought, oh, I have almost two weeks before a holiday, before the weekend that they arrive in Berlin. Therefore, maybe I could cycle there. And that was where the idea came from. Okay. So your route was from what was the name of that town again? J'm'en. J'm'en. Which is I can't pronounce it. No, I think I can pronounce it correctly, but it sounds exactly like if you said in French, I'm lying. Really? Yeah. Because the French verb to lie is Montier, right? So I lie is J'm'en. I thought it was like J'm'en Fou, which is another thing that's something else completely. But not the same verb. No. J'm'en is like, okay. It's like, I am lying. Really? Yeah. So there's a whole... I mean, is that not the atomology of that French town? I don't know. Maybe it is. Maybe the town doesn't really exist. And people were like, I'm going to go to, I'm lying. I've come all the way from the Belgian French border. Whereabouts? J'm'en. No, no, really. Oh, so you didn't go. Okay. So you started there. Why there in particular? Because the train went there and it was... So there's different types of trains. And in France, they have a good high-speed train network, for example. But you can't take a bike on a high-speed train very easily. Often, yeah. They're very fast. You can catch up with them. You can catch it. It's really difficult. No, because they have... You've got to put it in like a special bag. So it's almost like carrying a suitcase onto the train instead of carrying a bike on. I'm going to put the bike in a bag, not the train in a bag. Not the train. I tried that. It doesn't work either. Big bag. Yeah. Big bag. So I found trains, which are not the fast trains, or the TER, which are just regional trains. And you can take a bike on those easily. So that was why I picked that. So it was a French train. Because when you're taking a train that crosses borders, it's just a bit more complicated to find a train that you can put a bike on. So I didn't want to bother. And also I wanted to do as much of it as I could, as much of the journey as I could. Just if I'd gone from Paris, I think it would probably have been 11 or 12 days. So literally the whole of my holiday. Oh my gosh. And I just needed a bit of time to pack and plant my route in Paris before I left. Yeah. Because going from Paris to Berlin is what? About 1000 kilometers. If I'd done the whole thing, I think it would have been 1100. Right. Actually. It was quite a lot. It was quite far. So I cut off a few hundred. All right. So you did something like 750 or 800 or something like that, did you? No. Because no. 1100 minus 200. Oh yeah. I did 930 to get there. Okay. That's significant. Yeah. It was great. Was it? Yeah. I flat. Thank goodness for that. I know. All right. So what was the route that you took exactly? So I went across the bottom of Belgium into a tiny bit of the Netherlands, the bit that comes down in between Belgium and Germany, where Maastricht is. Okay. Obviously, a lot more of the Netherlands is further north. And then into Germany. I arrived in Germany quite a little bit. Dusseldorf. And the way that I planned it was essentially, I planned the train to German. And then I opened Google Maps. I took a pen. And I put the pen on the map between German and Berlin. And then that was my route. So I planned the most direct route I possibly could. Put a pen on the map. So it would make a straight line. Like, we have ruler on the map. Between German and Berlin. And then I just looked along the map. And every 100 kilometers or so, I was like, right, that's where I'll spend the night. And that was what I did. Okay. So that I would make it as direct as possible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because obviously, I'm not going to take motorways or anything like that. And you can use things like Google Maps as a kind of guide to plan things. And there were also established cycle routes all across Europe, which are good. But the problem with them is they often won't take you on the most direct route. So you end up adding a lot of kilometers because it wants you to go along a scenic route and to visit these lovely villages and things, which is great if you've got the time. But if you're goal is to get somewhere, it doesn't always work out. So how many days did it take? Nine. Nine. Yes. Eight nights. Nine days or? Eight nights. Yes. And then after Berlin, I also had another night on the road because I took two trains from Berlin back to Paris. Yeah. I took one train from Berlin to Barden Baden, which is near Strasbourg, but on the German side of the border. And then I cycled from Barden Baden to Strasbourg. But I stayed in between them. I stayed the night in between them. Why do you call Barden Baden? Why twice? Why not just Barden? I'm not sure. Bard means bath in German. So lots of spa towns have in the name. So this is like D. It's like spa spa spa. Yeah. Okay. It's like maybe I wonder if the city of Bath in England was established first and they were like, well, it's like the German bath, but it's better than English bath. So let's call it bath bath. Right. Twice as good as Bath. So good. They named it twice. Yeah. New York, New York, New York. Three times unintentionally. So all right. So you, where did you stay each time? Oh, so you can ping or what? No, I can't. So I've done this lots of times. I've done big cycling trips, lots of times. And normally I do them in the summer. And in the summer I can't because I've done them in France, Italy and Corsica. And you can be sure in all of those places that in the summer, the weather will be hot and the days will be long. But in the spring, that seemed like a bigger risk. So I didn't camp. Which is obviously good because it means you don't have to carry a tent. So instead, what I did was it's like couch surfing, you know, couch surfing. Yeah. But there's a couch surfing website that is especially for cyclists. And it's called Warm Showers. Which is an odd name. But it's not an odd website. It's a good website. Video is still recording. Yeah. If we've been talking for one hour and two to six minutes. Wow. It's 26 minutes. We're very bad at being succinct, don't we? That's not what this podcast is about. Evidently. TikTok is. That's what TikTok is. No, no, don't get me started. Yeah, listen, I'm really bad at TikTok. So, so you stayed warm showers. I know. I know. Okay. And it's basically an app that allows you to meet up with other people and sleep on their couch and stuff. Yeah, it's couch surfing, but for cyclists. Okay. And so I found from eight nights on the road. And one nine, if you include the way back, I found six people to host me. And the other three nights I stayed in hotels. So it was great. So I stayed one time I stayed on a pig farm in the middle of nowhere in Germany. That was great. Another time I stayed in a tiny little wooden house on the edge of a forest, which was beautiful. Sounds like a could be scary. Also scary. Also because I had just watched Stranger Things. Have you seen the things? I haven't seen Stranger Things. There's a lot of monsters chasing people through a forest. Right. So it was scary, but also beautiful. And you're in Germany as well. So you're like fairy tales. Yeah. It's very dangerous. Is this where Hansen and Gretel nearly got eaten? Yeah. And then I did follow a trail of breadcrumbs. Did you really? Yeah. Because I thought I might eat some cake. She didn't really. I didn't. That was a really bad joke as well. That's all right. Yes. So I stayed in some great places and with lovely people. And because they're also cyclists, all of the people who host a cyclist, they just know what you want, which is a comfortable bed and a lot of food. Yeah. And a warm shower, hence the name. Right. Yes. Okay. So how many kilometers did you manage to do each day, roughly? Depends on the day. The most I did was 130. Okay. And the least I think was about 85. All right then. And you said very flat. I mean you're going through like very flat. Going through the Netherlands. Which is famously flat. Yeah. The hillyest part was probably in the Netherlands. Really? I went through the only hilly part of the Netherlands. Okay. But I don't know about another language, but in French it's literally called the flat country. Yeah. So yeah. And never in English means low, doesn't it? Yeah, it does. So the low country. The low country, the lowlands. Yeah. Okay. So very flat. But in fact, I went through a slightly hilly part. I mean, it's very slight. Last summer I cycled around Corsica, around the edge of the island. That is not flat. No. One side of it's flat. And the other side is very much not. Yeah. So how do you, how you, you didn't have to deal with many hills this time? No, it's very nice. So tell me about cycling up hills as a cyclist. What, I mean, because like most people have probably had experience of cycling and those times when you haven't get up a hill, it's horrible. And you think, why am I doing this? I just want this to stop. Yeah. Why do you, why, why, why do you do this? What's the, tell me, tell me something about going up hills. Yeah. Going up hills is, I don't think it's that difficult. What's really difficult on a bike is when you have a headwind. So that's a wind coming towards you that's slowing you down. Because the good thing about a hill is you know when it's going to end. And when you're cycling into the wind, it could just be like that for the entire day. And so you feel like you're making a lot of effort when you're cycling into the wind. But you're not getting anywhere very fast because the wind is against you. And that's obviously that can be very powerful. So you can be working really hard and not really getting anywhere. And that's what is very demoralising and difficult. But if you're cycling up a hill, it feels like an achievement. First of all, whereas cycling against the wind, there's no sort of tangible sense for achievement there. And also you can see where it's going to end. And you get the downhill afterwards. Yes. Which is glorious. It's all downhill from, from, from exactly. Once I once I cycled uphill, I did a 14 kilometer uphill. Wow. And it wasn't steep, but it was uphill. Yes. Steadily it was in the out, at the edge of the Alps. How long does that take? Oh, I don't remember, but it was a long time. Okay, so a couple of hours. I can't an hour maybe. I really can't remember. Yeah, no more than an hour, I think. And that on that hill, I think I did stop to have something to eat, like to have an energy bar or something. But then the downhill was also 14 kilometers long. Wow. And that's just amazing. And how fast do you go in a situation like that? It depends. Last summer, I did mountain vantue, which is the mountain. It's like after you did mountain vantue. Mountain vantue. Mountain vantue. Mountain vantue. Mountain vantue. Three next. I see your French is really coming along. It's actually vantue. Oh, yeah. Of course. Why is it vantue? And then vantue anyway. Never mind. Mountain vantue, which is a famous mountain in the Alps? No, it's in Provence. Okay. Oh, it's at the top of Provence in the Vaux Clues. And it's very famous because it's often on the Tour de France. And it's famously difficult, even though it's not that high, but it's called vantue because so vant in French means wind, good work. So you have been working on it. And it's very windy. Windy is Mount Windy. Yeah. And the fastest wind speeds ever recorded on earth were recorded on the top of mountain vantue. Seriously? I know. I didn't believe. I'm not sure that's still the case, but definitely for a long time, it was the case. I don't think it's been beaten. Is that only because, like, they're the only ones who have the recording equipment? Yeah, there is always that, isn't that? The wind recording equipment was invented on that mountain. It was in France. Yeah. But that was hard work. Yeah, okay. But then the speeds, though, the you. And then going, yeah, that's why I started talking about it because I can't remember when I did that 14 kilometer up and 14 down. I can't remember what speed I got to, but I remember on Mount Vantue last year going downhill, getting to like, I think it was 73 kilometers an hour. So I'm not a little dangerous. Terrifying. Terrifying. Yeah. And then we found out afterwards a few months later, we found out that the bike I was on, which was my mum's I'd borrowed, actually had a cracked frame. So really shouldn't have been cycling it. So I know that was quite scary. Okay, side-questioning. I'm going to ask you, I'm going to ask you about the trip and stuff in a moment and continue with that. But side-question, have you ever had a crash on your bike? Yes. I had one. The biggest one I've ever had was this year on the 11th of March in Paris. The infamous crash date? I know that date so well because I've put it on so many medical forms. Because I was cycling along, it was like about quarter to eight in the morning on a Saturday. I was going to work. It was not a busy time on the roads. And I was cycling down the boulevard, the Sebastopol in the centre of Paris. Normally very busy. Yes, but not at that time in the morning. And they've got a dedicated cycle lane. Yeah, so it's not too bad. It's dedicated. It's really. It's so keen on its job. It loves it. So it was a dedicated cycle lane and I was going down it and then you get to the Houda Houda at the bottom, which is again quite a busy road, but not at this time in the morning. And somebody on a bicycle on a higher bike came zooming around the corner of the Rouda River into my side of the bike lane on the boulevard, Sebastopol and smashed right into me and knocked me off. Whoa. And there was a cake on the back of my bike. This is the worst part. Yeah. And the first thing I said was mongato. Which means my cake. As the cake flew into the air. This is the brilliant thing. The cake I had attached it with bungees and it was in a plastic tupperware that seals really, really well. Yeah. And it was the perfect size for the cake. The cake was fine. Completely fine. The cake on the other hand. The cake was not fine. I luckily was wearing a helmet which saved my life. And really you waxed your head on the floor. It smacked my head on the pavement. Oh my god. Really hot. Wow. And got a concussion. Yeah. And then I phoned work and nobody picked up because nobody was... I never do. I was never do. Or is it nobody was stuffing their phones before 8am? Yeah, yeah, true. And then the guy who hit me was all like, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That was my fault. I was like correct. It was your fault. They were a cycle like that. And then he got on his bike and cycled off. Oh, okay. Leaving me on the floor with a concussion. Is that a crime? It is a crime, but I'm never going to catch a MMI. Well, yeah. So that's that. I've just let it go. But then I got signed off work for 8 days and I had to go for a brain scan. And yeah, it was quite a big deal. Was that an MRI scan? Yes. How was that? MRI scan, that's when you have to lie down and they put you inside this horrible tube. It was all right. And yeah. You get all these weird noises around you. The worst part was they said I needed an injection for the brain scan. So I got there and the guy looked, the radiographer looked at my file and to check why I was there. And he said to me, okay, you might not, we might not need to give you the injection. If you can stay really still and the images are clear enough, we won't give you the injection. And I hate injections. So I said before. I'm going to be so good. I'm not going to move at all. So I was like frozen in this machine. And then they did the scan and he came out again and said it's okay. We don't need to give you the injection. Thank goodness. Because I would have hated that. But yes, so that happened on Saturday. I continued on to work because I didn't know what else to do. But I was cycling along, you're crying. Yeah. Oh my god. I really stressed out and I didn't want to do it. I think I was okay until he cycled off and then it really upset me. Yeah, because it's not a good thing to do. That's a shitty thing to do. It is really bad. So I was very upset and then got to work. And everyone was like, I don't think you can teach. And I was like, I'll be fine. I'm just going to go and teach now. And they were like, no, sit down. We're going to take your lesson for you. And then I got a taxi. I got sent home an taxi. Did you have symptoms? It wasn't anything terrible. I just, I had a very bad headache that didn't go away for a long time. And I was struggling to kind of make full sentences and do anything. Quite important as an English teacher. Quite useful. Quite useful. Yeah. But that was a Saturday. And so I did see my doctor immediately. And she obviously gave me a medical note for that day. Because in France, you have to get all your absences accounted for if you've got a medical problem, which is fine. So she gave me a note for that day. And she said, I'll put it down for tomorrow as well, even though the next day was Sunday. And then I was due to go to work again on the Monday, because it was an intensive week at work. Which is when we teach intensive courses. All day every day. All day every day when students come for a 30-hour course in one week. So those are my busy weeks, obviously. So I went into work on the Monday. And it was like an out of body experience. It was awful. I mean, I think... Why? Why? Because I felt like I was floating above my body and looking down on the classroom. This is after two days. You came back after two days. Okay, I thought I could come back. And as I was... The thing is, the thing about something like concussion is when you're just having a quiet time at home, you don't notice the symptoms. Because all I was doing was sitting, reading, I went to the supermarket. I had some... Sitting, reading, falling over. I didn't have to do anything mentally demanding. Right. I slept quite a lot. And then I went to work. Our cycle to work actually was just stupid of me. And as I was cycling to work, everything was very heightened. Meaning all of the colours were brighter than usual. Was it the cake that you didn't know? It was not just the cake that I'd eaten. That was the concussion. Concussion cake. Concussion cake. And then I got to work. And I said to the head of the adult department, Andrea, I was like, I'm going to go and teach, but I don't think I can do it for very long. She said, okay, well, keep me posted. And I, yeah, I went in and tried to teach. And I don't think the students would have noticed anything terrible. Because the first day of the course is quite... It's pretty much always the same. You basically give them a task where they're getting to know each other. They're doing a lot of talking. I don't have to do very much talking because the point is, I'm listening to them taking notes, giving corrections, that sort of thing. And helping them to get to know each other, because that's how the course is going to be a good course. Yeah. If they bond and want to talk to each other. Yeah. So it's quite formulaic the Monday morning. So I did it without too many issues. Except for when they asked me questions, sort of, grammar questions, sort of a cap of your questions. And I couldn't find my words. Yeah. And then I came out of the class and I said, I said, I've got a brain scan booked this afternoon. And then I'm... Because I already had it booked. And then I don't know, I'm going to be back. So I had the brain scan. And then I was... Then I saw my doctor again. It was a different doctor, but at the same hospital. A doctor's surgery. Who looked at my notes and said, oh yeah, you shouldn't have gone back to work. And then sign me off for another week. Imagine if Tina Turner had died that day as well. I can't make all sentences. And I had to hold onto the table for support. Not that it's Kate, that sounds... They would have been like, maybe we shouldn't have signed up for this course. I'm joking, of course, but... No. I've been glib, but so no, that sounds horrible. Yeah, so... I mean, I was very, very lucky. Thank goodness I was wearing a helmet. It literally saved my life, but helmet. And now I have to buy a new helmet, because you're supposed to, after a big impact, you're supposed to buy a new one. Right. And it was quite new and very expensive. That rota, been crashed into you. I know. I have to buy another one. Which I haven't got around to doing yet, which is a bit naughty of me. I will do it. Well, thank goodness you were wearing a helmet. Yeah. Where are helmet kids? Really do where are helmet. Really, really do. And I used to almost always wear a helmet, but if I was doing a short trip, you know, to a friend's house or the supermarket, or something like that, or a trip where I was just cycling next to the canal, for example, and there were no cars, I often wouldn't put my helmet on, because it's a five-minute cycle or whatever. Now I always do every single time. Yeah. Because it will take us some... Nutter on a rental bike, who doesn't give a crap. They're very big. Those rental bikes. They're very big and heavy. Electric ones. Was it the white and green ones? Yes. They're really heavy. They are very heavy. I mean, he fell off as well. But he just... So there's some justice. Yeah. He got back on it. And as he got back on, I said, you can't just cycle off and leave me. And he was like, oh, yeah. Yes, I can. Well, then I turned around to look at my bike. I'd broken a few spokes on the front wheel. I had to replace them, but I turned around to look at my bike and to pick it up again, to try and start picking it up. And then when I turned back, it gone. When your back was turned... When my back was turned. Then cowardly. That's exactly what happened. It's come back. Yeah. You turned your back and he just disappeared. Yeah. What an absolute shit. Yeah. It wasn't a great day. No. But then it was okay. You know, I wasn't too bad. I think... I think we are very lucky to live in a country where we have very good healthcare and we get signed off. We need to be signed off. And that's that. Then you're paid properly and, you know, your need for rest is recognised and then there you go. Absolutely. Wow. Wow, I didn't expect the full... The full... Sorry. Like a concussion story. But no, no, I didn't know. I didn't know that. It's just a new hour episode, isn't it? Yeah, well, you know what, Kate? The episode I did before this one, which is just me on my own. Guess how long that one ended up being? Three hours. Three hours. Are you talking to yourself? Me talking to myself. I thought only I could do it to myself for that long. Can we put the video back? I can't see it anymore. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can we just do this? Yeah, no, you've got to... I'm not going to... You look so young in that picture. Does that have a beard? So when my listeners, when my computer falls asleep and it has to be woken up again, that you see a picture of me and I have to enter my password and the picture of me is me without a beard and I do look younger without a beard. Yeah, so why? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So, all right. What about your... Can we pause? Can I just say... Can we have another cupcake? Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. If we have it, will you have half? Yeah, definitely. Solid. I was going to ask you about the rest of the trip to Berlin. Were there any... I mean, it's... Okay, so you got back on your bike after that, which happened in March, did it? That happened in March. And then you did your trip in April, May? End of April, beginning of May. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, all right, you weren't deterred by your... No, not at all. ... your traumatic experience. No, no. And in fact, you decided to double down on the cycling and do really long distance. Yeah. What were the roads like that you were... I know it's flat, but you riding through Germany, I imagine Germany going long distances, I think, Autobahn. People driving BMWs incredibly fast. I didn't go on the Autobahn. No, no, no, no. Obviously, because it wasn't an auto, it was a far-hard... It's really hard to pronounce. My first... Can I tell you about my first proper conversation in German? Yes. So, I started studying German in... February, maybe. After I got invited on this trip, I was like, I better learn some German. So, I started studying. And thank you. Hold on, Kate. How are we going to manage the consumption of the cake? You go first and I'll tell you what I'm saying. You carry on with your anecdote. I'm going to mute my microphone in three, two, one. Poo. I wonder which point the poo cut out. Early... They didn't hear the poo. Yeah, and see, I don't know if you can hear him. I was just saying that. So, I started learning German to be able to obviously navigate my way a little bit more easily around Germany. And my first proper conversation in German was as I was cycling around the edge of Dusseldorf, which I'm probably pronouncing wrong, I'm sorry, German speakers. And I was going over this bridge and I wanted to take a photo of the view of the city. I didn't go into Dusseldorf. It looked very nice from the outside. And so, I stopped on this bridge and I have a bicycle where you clip into the pedals, you have you wear special shoes that clip to the pedals because it makes you more efficient on your pedaling. So, I had to unclip. So, I stopped on this bridge and I unclipped one foot and sort of put it to the side. And a family was walking past me, a moment and dad and a little girl. And the girl watched me do this. She was about six years old maybe. And then she said, Cool as farad, which means cool bicycle. And I was like, oh my goodness, I understood her. It was very cool. I was very happy. And I said, donker, which means thank you. And then I took my photo and got back on my bike and cycle passed them again. And then I waved at them and said, juice, which means goodbye. So, juice. But Apple juice. No, juice. Juice. T-H-U-S-S. Juice. Juice. Here. Juice. And it was just, it was obviously not an in-depth conversation. But it was just very pleasing to have this like, fully genuine interaction in a language that I'd only been learning for about three months by that point, I think. And it was, and I, one thing that was nice about it was they, from that conversation probably don't know that I don't really speak German as well. I felt like I tricked them. That they maybe think my German's okay. It's not good. You did it. You kind of checked the boxes of a successful interaction in another language. Oh, he's successful. Which is where you say the right things at the right time and that you both leave. The other person goes away not knowing that you're a relative. I suck at German. Yeah. No idea. It was great. Yeah, well done. Yeah, it was really nice. It's cool bicycle. Yeah. What kind of bicycle is it? It's a touring bike. Which is, it's similar to a road bike in that the tires aren't quite thin. But it's, the tires are thicker than on a normal road bike. So you can go, for example, if you have a track with a bit of gravel on it or something, you can go on that. And they're also heavier than road bikes. So you can put a lot of luggage on them. They've got a rack on the back. Yes, on the back. Mud guards. Yeah, you can put a rack on the front as well if you want to. Yeah, okay. Yeah, they can carry a lot of weight. Handle bars. Yes, they have handlebars. Yeah, good. What kind of handlebars? Not a unicycle. What kind of handlebars? Drop handlebars. Drop handlebars. Yeah, meaning that they're straight and then they drop down either side. They sort of drop down and forwards. Yes. You're going to lean forwards. You can. Do you have those cool brakes where the brake handles, you can, with those drop handlebars, you can hold them on the sort of horizontal part or you can lean forwards like Batman in the dark night. Yes, I do look like Batman. You kind of go into that forward position. Yeah. And you've got like trigger style brakes on the front as well. Yes, I've only got them on the side. On the side. They're on the side of the handlebars. That's where the brakes are. So if you're standing up holding the top part, if you're kind of climbing up a hill, you can't brake. No. Okay, all right. You've got to get used to it. It's quite, it's also a very, very big bike because I'm quite a tall person. And it was made for me. I went. Well, really? Yeah, I went to the shop. It's called Thorn. They're a very, very good bike manufacturer based in the UK. And the frames are made in, I'm pretty sure it's Taiwan. And you go there and they take all your measurements and then the frame is made for you. So because I'm quite tall, it's a very big bike. It was my 21st birthday present for my parents who are very keen cyclists. Two of my parents are. My mother and my stepdad. Only two of your parents are. I've got four. You've got four parents. Yeah, which is honestly greedy. But they were great. So. That's nice. Okay, fantastic. All right. What's the, what's the best part of the trip? Was it that moment when you were in Spur German? That moment was really lovely. Where a girl said, wow, cool bicycle. What was it again? Cool. Cool as far, hard. Because it sounds almost like she's going, cool as far. How old was this guy? He was about six years old. Six years old. She was like, look, she has a cool as fuck bicycle. I would love that. And cool as far. Farad. I think I'm saying farad. Farad is it farad. I'm rolling the arm mostly because I recently learned to roll arms. They're not, there are arms. Farad. And those, some Germans roll their arms a little bit. Okay. I think it depends on your form and journey. In Düsseldorf, maybe they. I don't know. This is my attempt to say it. Farad, it's hard. F-A-H-R-R-R-A-D. It's far harder than you think. Then you think, yeah. But I'm shh. There'll be German listeners that you can jump into the comment section, guys, and help. Germans, please forgive my, my pitiful attempts to speak your language. It's a beautiful language. Absolutely love German. Yeah, yeah, me too. Do you speak German? Nine. No, I don't. I'm not going to the contrary. Yeah, no, I really don't. I don't. But I like hearing it. I like it when I hear people speaking German. This is great. I love all the languages. I love hearing people speaking them in, you know, when I hear people just over here, people in conversations and just like, listen to it and think, which language is that? Wow. It's all those different sounds. I was hearing someone speaking Arabic the other day in the shop where I was taking a package back into the shop and they were just a couple of people chatting in Arabic and it's like, wow, that's awesome. So that your journey, did it take longer or less time than this episode of the podcast? Oh, definitely less time. Yeah, for sure. All right. Yeah. Okay. I listened to a podcast as I was cycling. Yeah, what did you listen to? It's a podcast to learn German. It's called Coffee Break German. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, Coffee Break. I do know the Coffee Break series. Every time I look at the lists of the top podcast in the language learning category, they're always at the top of the list. Coffee Break German. Coffee Break French. Coffee Break Italian. Then there's Luke's English podcast down somewhere further down the list. That's very good. That's very good for getting you from beginner or in my case, nothing up to some understanding. So they're very good at getting you from Paris to Berlin. Yes, on the bicycle. On the bicycle. Yeah. There's another one. Alph Deutsche gesakt. Alph Deutsche gesakt. Do you know what that means? Apparently it means German as it's spoken. I think it was spoken German. But it's a podcast listener. One of my listeners does that podcast. It's for higher level German speakers though. So if you get to sort of be... Gessakt. Gessakt. Gessakt. Gessakt. Yes. Okay. The Alph Deutsche gesakt. I'm probably pronouncing it wrong. But yeah, and when you get to that B1, B2 level, then you can start listening to Alph Deutsche gesakt. I look forward to it. I'm going to continue studying German. It's great. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You like it. Yeah. I think in Robin's podcast, that's the name of the host, he does sort of, you know, conversational stuff. It's not just instructional stuff. So if you want to listen to... It's probably something similar to Luke's English podcast, but I'm almost 100% certain that it's shorter and more efficient. It will be more efficient. Yes. Very. Which is not hard, is it? If that's a low bar for that. Depends. Depends what people are looking for. If they're looking for rambling conversations where we go from A to B to G to N and throw a few jokes in between, then, you know, that's what they... That's what they get, isn't it, with this and the cake? If they want to hear someone eating a cake or not here, someone eating a cake. Can you unmute me and talk for a bit? I didn't... I didn't mute you. You've been eating a bit of cake and I didn't mute you, but you've been... No one noticed. Did you hear that, listeners? You didn't, did you? Can you mute me now so I can eat some more, please? Cake will be muted in three, two, one. Okay. So, listeners, what else shall I ask Kate? I did actually write some things down. We've got to stop this at some point because otherwise, I mean, do we? Should we... Yeah, I have to go to work. You do? What... Oh, really? What about your lunch? I have a meeting so I can eat during the meeting. You can eat during the meeting. Oh, really? Everyone's going to be okay with that. I'll mute myself. Okay, so my question is, what kind of bike do you have? You've answered that. How did you get into cycling? Okay. Your parents, your parents are keen cyclists. Have you ever done a jump on your bike? Have you ever done a jump on your bike? No, she's shaking her head. No. Have you ever done a... I'm not 12, Luke. I know. Have you ever done a skid on your bike? Doing a skid, listeners, that's where you pull the brakes and... Maybe one of the tires slides along the floor. Something you do when you're 12. Anything that's really cool. I've done that. I've done that by accident while it's snowing. All right. That's not good. Snow is the worst condition in which to try and ride a bike. I thought drunk would be the worst condition. Sorry, snowing is the worst weather condition. Also, it's snowing and also icy roads. It's snowing when you're cycling when you're drunk and it's snowing. And it's snowing. Yeah. That is a real recipe for disaster. Yeah, I've never had a crash. You answered that. Have you ever gone over the handlebars? No, luckily. Yeah. Okay. And there are a lot of people who have. How about this question, Kate? If you haven't ridden a bike for quite a long time and then you do it again, is it easy to remember how to do it? Kate's still eating her cupcake. Yes, it's like riding a bike. Hey, obviously I set that one up. Do you want me to explain that? Go on. If something's like riding a bike, that's exactly what it means, the thing that Lucas just said. It means once you've learned it, you never forget it. Yeah. So, for example, I've been away on holiday or, you know, for a few weeks, I've been off work and I come back and it's like, oh, cards, you know, a bit rusty. I haven't been taught for a while. And Kate says, oh, I don't worry, it's just like riding a bike. You'll get straight back into it. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Meaning something that's something you haven't done for a while, but you can do it easily. You'll never forget how to do it. It's like riding a bike. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I think that's probably a good... Do you think we've talked enough now? I think we've probably done enough. Oh, goodness me. How much is too much? It's all a relic. Is it a piece of string? It's, yeah, exactly how long is a piece of string? Well, I guess the listeners can conclude that they got, you know, an extra two hours for nothing, you know. And it's always free, isn't it? Yeah, unless they are paid subscribers who get their premium content and no adverts, because in some regions, the episodes will be interrupted at the... Can you interrupt something at the start? I don't know. But in some regions, there's an adverts... They'll be profeded by an adverts. Yeah, they can be a little advert at the beginning and there's often one in the middle that will interrupt proceedings and then one at the end, but if you're a paid subscriber to the Luxeaguelish podcast premium, then you don't get any of those interruptions and you also don't get... Right. Yeah, and you get access to all the premium episodes as well, of course. What's in the premium episodes? I teach. What I'm missing out on. I teach stuff. There's stories. Oh, nice. Yeah, I've been doing a series lately called Storytime. Very, very original. Time. Did you come up with it? It was time for a Storytime. And tell stories about things that have happened to me in my life. For example, I've never done a bike crash story, but I could maybe if I could just think of a time when I fell off a bike, make that into a story. I've done some episodes where I'd tell a story and then I'd teach some vocab from the story. Then I'd provide them with little grammar exercises using the story, pronunciation practice, where they can listen, repeat after me. All available at teachelook.co.uk slash premium. That's good, isn't it? Hmm. Do you have a little tip there, a little answer? What percentage of what you put out would you say is premium? In terms of like behind the premium paywall. Yes. So I tend to do a premium series, something like every four episodes. So there might be four episodes of the free podcast to be fair. I probably do too much free, and I should probably be making people pay for more of it, but it's just the way I do it. But I'll do a pretty much an episode every week of the free show. Right. And that's just uninterrupted most of the time. Yeah. Unfortunately. Unfortunately. Okay. Maybe. Yeah, or less like. In this case. Yeah, perhaps. But I mean, uninterrupted in the sense that they come every week. Oh, sorry. But also uninterrupted. When you press play, that's it. Does this stream of consciousness? Just talking. Every month I'll upload a premium series. And that would be normally two or maybe more episodes. The first one is where I'm telling the story and teaching some stuff. The second one is pronunciation practice. Also do different types of premium episode. There's language review ones where I go through conversations I've had on the podcast, pull out. Oh, nice. Language that has come up and then have a list. And I explain, talk about it and demonstrate it and highlight little things. And then do pronunciation practice that sometimes those are quite long series. Because if I have 20 items of vocab, I cover the first 10 in the first episode, then pronunciation practice, then the next 10. They're more pronunciation practice. That's four episodes. Sometimes I will just talk, you know, ramble like this. And then afterwards go through lots of the lots of the vocab and expressions that came up naturally and then do pronunciation practice. Sometimes do a kind of a deep dive into an area of grammar. Oh, I love a deep dive. I did something like 12 part series on present perfect. Of course you did. The present perfect is the reason that we have jobs. Yeah, it is. Thank you all for the present perfect. And that and phrasal verbs. Keeping us all in employment. Keeping us all in employment. Yeah. Keeping English learners everywhere in a perpetual state of frustration. But we have jobs. It's like dentists like in the sense that they're glad that we have teeth. Yeah. Thank goodness teeth exist. Oh, I'd be out of the job. I mean, thank goodness that dentists are the irony of being a dentist that you're there to try and help people with their oral health. But if everyone's teeth were fine, then they would be out of a job. So I'm not saying that dentists are also causing the tooth problems. It's not some conspiracy theory about dentists. What am I talking about? I don't know. I don't know. I've got an idea. I don't know why I said it's like dentists. I had an idea in my mind, but now I can't verbalise it. Fair enough. Anyway, never mind. We'll be there. Yeah, we've all been there. Kate, Billington, thank you very much for coming back onto my podcast. Luke Thompson with a pee. Thank you very much for having me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's been lots of fun. Thank you so much for bringing cake. It was delicious. You're very welcome. And take care on that bicycle. Thanks. I've got my helmet. Yeah, good. Always. New one. Not yet. Okay, I knew you held me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Should we tell everyone to follow you on TikTok with the British Council? Yeah, why not? The British Council's TikTok. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Although I haven't made any videos for a while because I'm kind of figuring out what to do next. But yeah, why not? We love that. We love that. Go on to TikTok. Search British Council. Yeah. British Council online. British Council online. I think that's what it's called. Yeah, yeah, do it. Also, mini English lessons on YouTube. There's even more of those now. British Council mini English lessons. If you want to watch Kate laughing. I laugh so much in those. We talked about the singular thing. One, didn't we? I love singular. Yeah, that's a good one. Yeah, watch those. They're fun. I like that. Cool. And you can follow me on Instagram. It might be top of the building, and at Instagram.com. Don't listen to Luke. Do listen to Luke. I mean, listen to his podcast. At Exynish Podcast. It's actually teacherleague.co.uk. Not English, Luke's EnglishPodcast.com. Although if you do type in Luke'sEnglishPodcast.com. If you can actually spell it, then that will also take you to to redirect it. Clever. Clever cover. Fair enough. All right, brilliant. Thank you, Kate. Thank you. Thank you to our listeners. And I hope that this was the correct speed. And there wasn't too much laughing, eating or sneezing. Who can tell? Who can tell? And listeners can decide on those things. But you know, such is life. We can't control or account for absolutely everything. Completely sure. Yeah. All right. All right. Thank you very much. Bye. Bye-bye. I'm still here. Still laughing. Well, what else can I add at the end here? Not that much, probably. That was a good episode, wasn't it? I hope so. I think if you're still here and you're still listening, then you will hopefully agree that that was a good fun episode with lots of different things included in it. Interesting stuff. Hopefully it kept you engaged and entertained from the start to the finish. Thank you again to Kate for her contribution and for the cupcakes. Of course, which were delicious. And I shared them with my family. My daughter in particular was absolutely delighted to have cupcakes. And I put one in her lunch box as a snack for a couple of days. She had a cupcake every day and she was chuffed, meaning really pleased. So that's nice, isn't it? All right. There you go. Fine. Good. You're still here. Leave me your comments. Of course, I'm always curious to know, you know, what's been going through your head while listening to these episodes. Hopefully you do have thoughts running through your head as you listen to my content. That's the idea, right? So, you know, if you feel like it, you could put your thoughts into the form of words, put together in the right form, in the right order, constructed to make meaningful sentences in order to express how you feel listening to the episode. Okay. And you can just write those in the comments section on my website. You can write them on social media. You could write them in an email if you like. That's always nice. I'm recording this little outro part because you've got an intro, like an introduction, outro. It's not really a word, but you've got the intro at the beginning. And then the outro, which is what you use to kind of go out of the episode at the end anyway, at the end here. So I'm recording this in the middle of June. So this is a few weeks after having the conversation with Kate. And yeah, I'm still stuck in a time loop, of course. Recording all these episodes in advance. What I actually prefer to do is record an episode and then publish it. And then record another one and then publish that. I like to do it. I like to keep my life reasonably simple in that way. And just record, then publish, then record, then publish. Then I know where I am and what's going on. But that's not what's been happening recently, of course. But just to kind of give you an update, yeah. So everything's fine. My wife is totally fine. She's still pregnant. Of course, very much so. The due date for child too is the beginning of July. So my wife is about eight and a half months pregnant now. And she's, you know, she went to the hospital this morning just for a checkup. The hospital where she'll be giving birth. Everything's fine. The baby's doing fine. It's all fine, fine, fine. So we are basically ready. The curtains in our apartment. This is a long story. It's still an ongoing situation, but everything's going to be fine. And so we're, you know, the child could arrive at any moment. But when you're listening to this, so you'll be listening to this in August, I think. So hopefully all going, if all goes well, then the baby will be with us. We'll see. But anyway, I hope you're doing fine. I hope you've been having a nice summer. I think I'm going to end here because this is too long, isn't it? This is too much. Isn't it too much? Someone's going, no, it's not. I keep going. We like this. Okay. All right. Well, you're going to have to wait until next probably next week to listen to the next episode. I'll give you no clue as to what that one will be. It's, but it should be fun as well. But if you can't wait, then you can always go back into the episode archive. If you know, there's hundreds of episodes there that you could listen to as well. Loads of them. Have you heard all the episodes you might not have? Go back and check out some of the other ones. Teachelook.co.uk slash episodes. Or just if you're listening in a podcast app, just scroll back, just do a bit of scrolling. And there you will find all sorts of other episodes for you to enjoy. And you could like, you know, put them in your playlist or whatever and listen to them. It's up to you. Actually, I've just remembered there is something I could add here. That is, if you're into cycling and you enjoyed listening to Kate describe her cycling trip. And that's the kind of content you've been looking for. Then you could go back all the way back to episodes 136 and 196 long, long term leapseders. Do you remember those episodes? So episode 136 was called cycling from London to Paris. And episode 196 was called cycling from coast to coast. Two episodes about long cycling adventures, both with my friend Ben Fisher, who is a dedicated and enthusiastic cyclist, which you would expect, wouldn't you, if he's cycling such long distances? I mean, if he didn't like cycling, you'd think, why? Why are you doing this to yourself? Is it you just can't afford a car? I don't know what's going on, but now he loves cycling. So, yeah, years ago, I did two episodes about cycling with Ben Fisher. The first one was after Ben had cycled from London to Paris. And you might be thinking, how did he, what did he cycle over the English channel? How did he deal with all the water that separates those two countries? Well, you'd have to listen to find out, to find out whether he swam with his bicycle on his back. Unlikely, to be honest, or whether he somehow floated, um, floating bicycle, I don't know, unlikely again. Or did he cycle under the water, cycling along the bottom of the, the, the sea bed? Also, unlikely. Or maybe he took some other form of transport. Maybe he put his bike on a boat or his bike on a train, which sounds exciting, doesn't it? Putting transport on other types of transport. Yeah. And by the way, if you want to, wait a minute, do you have like trains that go through the ocean in Europe? Well, sort of, just in case, I don't know where you are, where you're living. Most of you are like, yeah, the Eurostar, of course, Luke, but there's one person in another part of the world is like, what? You have trains that go through water? What, what, what? What kind of strange technology is this? Well, no, it's a tunnel. There's a tunnel that goes under the, under the English channel. It's called the Eurostar, the Euro Tunnel. Yeah, they tunnel under the, under the, not just through the water, but under the ground under the water. You know, I'm sure that you've got similar tunnels in other parts of the world as well. And now there's another person going, I didn't even realise that there was a, there was only water separating those two countries. I don't know who's listening to this. Who are you? Who are you with your lack of knowledge of anything? At this point, that person who doesn't know is just going, Luke, it's just me. I'm just a voice in your head. There's no real person in the world who, A, doesn't know about the, the tunnel between the tunnel that goes under the English channel. And B, there's certainly no people listening to this who didn't realise that there was C between England and France. Okay, everyone knows that it's, that Britain is an island and the England and France are not connected. Everyone knows that. Are you sure though? Are you sure? Voice in my head. Yes, I'm absolutely sure. Now get on with what you were saying about cycling and stuff. Okay? Okay, all right. Don't be so angry. All right. Okay, everything's okay. No need to be angry. All right. Well, it's okay. How did Ben travel from England? How did he cycle from London to Paris? Did he cycle through the water? Or did he take his bike on a boat? Or did he go through the Euro tunnel? Less exciting, but certainly more realistic. Anyway, if you want to hear that story, go back to episode 136. And that does include quite a lot of the cycling vocabulary that you might have been looking for, including all the different parts of a bicycle. So that's all included in episode 136. And then one episode 196 was cycling from coast to coast. Another interview with Ben Fisher. This time he raised the stakes and cycled an even longer distance in comparison to what he did before, cycling from London to Paris. This time he cycled from the north coast of France all the way to the south coast of France, which is a very long way. Actually, France is a large country. And it's not as large as some countries. Obviously, if you're living in China and you cycle from one end of China to the other, that's clearly a longer distance. But still, France is a fairly large country and cycling from the north to the south. It's a fairly long trip. In fact, I have to say it is a longer journey than the one that Kate did cycling to Berlin. Not to try to lessen Kate's achievement, but still, it is something. That's interesting. And that one's got a few stories in it, a few funny moments, including the moment when somewhere in the middle of France, Ben was exhausted, tired, thirsty, and hungry, and desperately needed a place to stay. He rode his bike into a campsite at the end of some long country road. And he thought that he'd found his place to stay for the evening. He thought he'd found his rest bite for the evening. But it turned out to be a nudist colony. Which is a, if you're wondering what a nudist colony is, is the sort of place where people like to spend all their time with no clothes on. That was awkward, isn't it? Oh, no, what's he going to do? Well, if you want to know what happened, you'll have to listen to the episode. So that's episode 136 and episode 196. Two other episodes about cycling with all the cycling vocabulary and a few stories in there too. Okay, so if you want to take a journey back even further back in time, go to those episodes and you will find them in your podcast app or on the episode page on my website. But anyway, thank you for listening to this. I will speak to you again soon. Okay, but for now, it's just time for me to say goodbye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
